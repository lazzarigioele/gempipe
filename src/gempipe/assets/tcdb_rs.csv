Ion permeation occurs by ion-ion contacts in single file fashion through the selectivity filter (Köpfer et al. 2014). A narrow pore lined with four arrays of carbonyl groups is responsible for
ion selectivity, whereas a conformational change of the four inner transmembrane helices (TMS2) is
involved in gating (Baker et al. 2007). Two gates have been identified; one is located at the inner bundle crossing and is activated by H+ while the second gate is in the selectivity filter (Rauh et al. 2017). The C-terminal domain mediates pH modulation (Hirano et al., 2011; Pau et al., 2007). KcsA exhibits a global twisting motion upon gating (Shimizu et al., 2008).  Activity is influenced by the phase of the lipid bilayer (Seeger et al. 2010), and occupancy of nonannular lipid binding sites increases the stability of the tetrameric complex (Triano et al. 2010).  The open conformation of KcsA can disturb the bilayer integrity and catalyze the flipping of
phospholipids (Nakao et al. 2014).  This protein is identical to the KcsA orthologue (P0A333) in Streptomyces coelicolor.  The stability of the pre domain in KcsA is stabilized by GCN4 (Yuchi et al. 2008).  The
potential role of pore hydration in channel gating has been evaluated (Blasic et al. 2015).  Having multiple K+ ions bound simultaneously
is required for selective K+ conduction, and a reduction in the number of bound K+ ions
destroys the multi-ion selectivity mechanism utilized by K+ channels (Medovoy et al. 2016).  The channel accomodates K+ and H2O molecules alternately in a K+-H2O-K+-H2O  series through the channel (Kratochvil et al. 2016). Insertion of KcsA is spontaneous and directional as the
cytosolic part of the protein does not translocate across the membrane barrier. Charged residues, not hydrophobic residues, are crucial for insertion of the unfolded protein
into the membrane via electrostatic interactions between
membrane and protein.  A two-step
mechanism was proposed. An initial electrostatic attraction between membrane and protein
represents the first step prior to insertion of hydrophobic residues into the hydrocarbon core of
the membrane (Altrichter et al. 2016). Bend, splay, and twist distinguish KcsA gate opening, filter opening, and filter-gate coupling, respectively (Mitchell and Leibler 2017). Details of the water permeability have been presented. Water flow through KcsA is halved by 200 mM K+ in the aqueous 
solution, which indicates an effective K+ dissociation constant in 
that range for a singly occupied channel. (Hoomann et al. 2013). A parameterized MARTINI program can be used to predict the hinging motions of the protein (Li et al. 2019). Activation of KcsA is initiated by proton binding to the pH gate upon an intracellular drop in pH which prompts a conformational switch, leading to a loss of affinity for potassium ions at the selectivity filter and therefore to channel inactivation (Rivera-Torres et al. 2016). An alteration in the conformational equilibrium of the intracellular K+-gate is one of the fundamental mechanisms underlying the dysfunctions of K+ channels caused by disease-related mutations (Iwahashi et al. 2020). Folding and misfolding of KcsA monomers during assembly and tetramerization has been examined (Song et al. 2021). The flexible C-terminus stabilizes KcsA tetramers at a neutral pH with decreased stabilization at acidic pH (Howarth and McDermott 2022). Under equilibrium conditions, in the absence of a transmembrane voltage, both water and K+ occupy the selectivity filter of the KcsA channel in the closed conductive state (Ryan et al. 2023).",{'uptake'},,,,"{'8345': 'potassium(1+)', '5585': 'water'}","{'8345': {'k'}, '5585': {'h2o'}}",R_1_A_1_1_1,"{'8345': set(), '5585': set()}"

The photoreceptor potential in Chlamydomonas triggers the generation of all or no flagellar Ca2+ currents that cause membrane depolarization across the eyespot and 
flagella (Sanyal et al. 2023). Modulation in membrane potential causes changes in the 
flagellar waveform, and hence, alters the beating patterns of 
Chlamydomonas flagella. The eyespot membrane potential is 
rhodopsin-mediated and is generated by the photoreceptor Ca2+ current or P-current. However, flagellar Ca2+ currents are mediated by unidentified voltage-gated calcium (VGCC or 
CaV) and potassium channels (VGKC). The voltage-dependent ion channel 
that associates with ChRs to generate Ca2+ influx across the 
flagella and its cellular distribution has been 
identified. Sanyal et al. 2023 presented evidence on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii predicting that CrVGCC4 
localizes to the eyespot and flagella and associates 
with channelrhodopsins. Further in silico interactome analysis of 
CrVGCCs suggested that they interact with photoreceptor 
proteins, calcium signaling, and intraflagellar transport components.

play an important role in excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal 
muscle via their interaction with RYR1, which triggers Ca2+ release from the sarcplasmic reticulum and ultimately results in muscle 
contraction. Long-lasting (L-type) calcium channels belong to the 
'high-voltage activated' (HVA) group (Jiang et al. 2018). The 3-d structure of a bacterial homologue has been solved (Jiang et al. 2018). Mutations in arginly residues in the TMS4 voltage lead to increased leak currently that may be responsible for hypokalaemic periodic paralysis (Kubota et al. 2020). Mutations in the voltage sensor domain of CaV1.1, the alpha1S subunit of the L-type calcium channel in skeletal muscle cause hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP), and these mutations give rise to gating pore currents (Wu et al. 2021). The voltage-gated T-type calcium channel is modulated by kinases and phosphatases (Sharma et al. 2023).

Closure of the Kir1.1 pH gate results from steric occlusion of the permeation path by the convergence of four leucines (or phenylalanines) at the cytoplasmic apex of the inner transmembrane helices. In the open state, K+ crosses the pH gate together with its hydration shell (Sackin et al. 2005). An inhibitory cholesterol binding site has been identified (Fürst et al. 2014). Conformational changes associated with an open activation gate have been identified, and these suggest an allosteric pathway that ties the selectivity filter to the activation gate through interactions between both transmembrane helices, the turret, the selectivity filter loop, and the pore helix. Specific residues involved in this conformational exchange that are highly conserved among human Kir channels have also been identified (Amani et al. 2020). Anionic lipids, especially cardiolipin,  initiate a concerted rotation of the cytoplasmic domain subunits. This action buries ionic side chains away from the bulk water, while allowing water greater access to the K+ conduction pathway (Borcik et al. 2020). Kv1.5 channels are regulated by PKC-mediated endocytic degradation (Du et al. 2021). Pore-forming TMSs control ion selectivity and the selectivity filter conformation in the KirBac1.1 channel (Matamoros and Nichols 2021).

A mutation in the GABAA receptor alpha 1 subunit, linked to human epilepsy, affects channel gating properties (Fisher 2004). The anti-convulsant stiripentol acts directly on the GABA(A) receptor as a positive allosteric modulator (Fisher 2009). The major central endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), also directly acts at GABA(A) receptors to potentiate the receptor at low GABA concentrations (Sigel et al., 2011). The recpetor is also allosterically regulated by neurosteroids via TMS1 of the beta subunit (Baker et al. 2010).  General anesthetic binding site(s) have been identified (Chiara et al., 2012; Woll et al. 2018). Hydrophobic anions potently and uncompetitively antagonize GABA (A) receptor function (Chisari et al., 2011). Regulated by neurosteroids; activated by pregnenolone and allopregnenalone (Costa et al., 2012). Allopregnanolone and its synthetic analog alphaxalone are GABAAR positive allosteric modulators (Yu et al. 2019). Different subunits contribute asymmetrically to channel conductances via residues in the extracellular domain (Moroni et al., 2011). Potentiated by general anaesthetics (Nury et al., 2011).  Both the alpha and beta subunits are important for activation by alcohols and anaesthetics (McCracken et al. 2010). Direct physical coupling between the GABA-A receptor (of 4 TMSs) and the KCC2 chloride transporter underlies ionic plasticity in cerebellar purkinje neurons in response to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Huang et al. 2013).  An anesthetic binding site has been identified (Franks 2015). Desensitization is
regulated by interactions between the second and third transmembrane segments which affect the ion
channel lumen near its intracellular end. The GABAAR and GlyR pore blocker, picrotoxin (TC# 8.C.1), prevents
desensitization (Gielen et al. 2015).  The mechanism of action of
methaqualone (2-methyl-3-O-tolyl-4(3H)-quinazolinone, Quaalude(R)), a sedative-hypnotic
and recreational drug. Methaqualone is a positive allosteric
modulator (PAM) at human alpha1,2,3,5beta2,3gamma2S GABAA receptors (GABAARs) expressed, whereas it displays diverse functionalities at the alpha4,6beta1,2,3delta GABAAR
subtypes, ranging from inactivity (alpha4beta1delta), through negative (alpha6beta1delta) or
positive allosteric modulation (alpha4beta2delta, alpha6beta2,3delta), to superagonism
(alpha4beta3delta) (Hammer et al. 2015).  The thyroid hormone L-3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3)
inhibits GABAA receptors at micromolar concentrations and has common features with neurosteroids
such as allopregnanolone (ALLOP). Westergard et al. 2015 used functional experiments on alpha2beta1gamma2 GABAA
receptors to detect competitive interactions between T3 and an agonist
(ivermectin, IVM) with a crystallographically determined binding site at subunit interfaces in the
transmembrane domain of a homologous receptor (glutamate-gated chloride channel, GluCl). T3 and
ALLOP showed competitive effects, supporting the presence of a T3 and ALLOP binding site at
one or more subunit interfaces. Residues in the beta3 subunit, at or near the
etomidate/propofol binding site(s), form part of the valerenic acid modulator binding pocket (Luger et al. 2015). IV general anesthetics, including propofol, etomidate, alphaxalone, and barbiturates, enhance GABAA receptor activation. These anesthetics bind in transmembrane pockets between subunits of typical synaptic GABAA receptors (Forman and Miller 2016). Carisoprodol can directly gate and allosterically modulate type A GABA (GABAA) receptors (Kumar et al. 2017). The former sedative-hypnotic and recreational drug methaqualone (Quaalude) is a moderately potent, non-selective positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors (GABAARs) (Hammer et al. 2015). A methaqualone analog, 2-phenyl-3-(p-tolyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one (PPTQ) exhibits intrinsic activity at micromolar concentrations and potentiates the GABA-evoked signaling at concentrations down to the low-nanomolar range (Madjroh et al. 2018). The PPTQ binding site is allosterically linked with sites targeted by neurosteroids and barbiturates.  Anesthetic pharmacophore binding has been studied (Fahrenbach and Bertaccini 2018). GABAA receptors are modulated via several sites by GABA, benzodiazepines, ethanol, neurosteroids and anaesthetics among others. Amundarain et al. 2018 presented a model of the alpha1beta2gamma2 subtype GABAA receptor in the APO state and in complex with selected ligands, including agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators. Sites in TMSs 2 and 3 are important for alcohol-induced conformational changes (Jung and Harris 2006). Many anesthetics and neurosteroids act through binding to the GABAAR transmembrane domainnad x-ray structures have revealed how α-xalone, a neurosteroid anaesthetic, binds and influences potentiation, activation and desensitization (Chen et al. 2018). AA29504 is an allosteric agonist and positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors (Olander et al. 2018). Allosteric shift analysis in mutant α1β3γ2L GABAA receptors indicates selectivity and cross-talk among intersubunit transmembrane anesthetic sites (Szabo et al. 2019). Several epilepsy-causing mutations have been identified in the genes of the α1, β3, and γ2 subunits comprising the GABAA receptor (Absalom et al. 2019). Constituents of the GABAA receptor include a transmembrane GARLH/LHFPL protein (TC# 1.A.82.1.7) and the inhibitory synaptic protein, neuroligin 2 (TC# 8.A.117.1.1) (Tomita 2019).  GABAA receptors containing mutant alpha5 and alpha1 subunits all had reduced cell surface and total cell expression with altered endoplasmic reticulum processing, impaired synaptic clustering, reduced GABAA receptor function and decreased GABA binding potency. Thus, GABRA5 is a causative gene for early onset epileptic encephalopathy (Hernandez et al. 2019).  Mutations at Gln242 or Trp246 that eliminate neurosteroid effects do not eliminate neurosteroid binding within the intersubunit site, but significantly alter the preferred orientation of the neurosteroid (Sugasawa et al. 2019). Binding sites and interactions of propanidid and AZD3043 within GABAAR have been identified (Wang et al. 2018). Clptm1 limits GABAAR forward trafficking from the ER to the plasma membrane, and it regulates inhibitory homeostatic plasticity (Ge et al. 2018). The mechanisms of potentiation and inhibition of GABAA receptors by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, niflumic and mefenamic acids, have been described (Rossokhin et al. 2019). GABAARs are targets for important classes of clinical agents (e.g., anxiolytics, anticonvulsants, and general anesthetics) that act as positive allosteric modulators (PAMs). PAMs bind selectively to a single intersubunit site in the GABAAR transmembrane domain (Jayakar et al. 2019). The gamma2 subunit is required for clustering of these receptors, for recruitment of the submembrane scaffold protein gephyrin to postsynaptic sites, and for postsynaptic function of GABAergic inhibitory synapses (Alldred et al. 2005). The fourth TMS of the gamma2 subunit is required for postsynaptic clustering, but both the major cytoplasmic loop and the fourth transmembrane domain contribute to efficient recruitment of gephyrin to postsynaptic receptor clusters and are essential for restoration of miniature IPSCs (Alldred et al. 2005). Oligomerization and cell surface expression of recombinant GABAA receptors tagged in the delta subunit have been examined (Oflaz et al. 2019). The isoxazoline ectoparasiticide, fluralaner, exerts antiparasitic effects by inhibiting the function of GABARs, but substitutions of Gly333 in TMS3 led to substantial reductions in the sensitivity to fluralaner (Yamato et al. 2020). A potent photoreactive general anesthetic with novel binding site selectivity for GABAA receptors has been identified (Shalabi et al. 2020). GABAA receptor neurosteroid binding sites have been reviewed (Alvarez et al. 2019). Missense variants in GABRA2 are associated with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE) as well as other disorders (Sanchis-Juan et al. 2020). Elevin novel molecules, identified using reinforcement learning, showed positive allosteric modulation, with two showing 50% activation in the low micromolar range (Michaeli et al. 2020). GABAA Receptor ligands interact with binding sites in the transmembrane domain and in the extracellular domain (Iorio et al. 2020). Many (but not all) sedative-hypnotics are capable of positively modulating the GABAA receptor by binding within a common set of hydrophobic cavities (McGrath et al. 2020). Allopregnanolone (3alpha5alpha-P), pregnanolone), and their synthetic derivatives are potent positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of GABAA receptors with in vivo anesthetic, anxiolytic, and anti-convulsant effects. Photoaffinity labeling procedures have been used to identify an intersubunit steroid-binding site in heteromeric GABA type A (GABAA) receptors (Jayakar et al. 2020). Diazepam binds to etomidate binding sites in the transmembrane receptor domain giving rise to antagonism (McGrath et al. 2020). The alpha1 subunit histidine 55 at the interface between the extracellular and transmembrane domains affects preactivation and desensitization of the GABAA receptor (Kaczor et al. 2021). Coordinated downregulation of KCC2 and the GABAA receptor contributes to inhibitory dysfunction during seizure induction (Wan et al. 2020). Loss of GABAergic inhibition provides a mechanism underlying GABRB2-associated neurodevelopmental disorders (El Achkar et al. 2021). GABAAR binds the anaesthetic, Propofol, to induced conformational changes (Yuan et al. 2021). Methaqualone (2-methyl-3-(o-tolyl)-quinazolin-4(3H)-one, MTQ) is a moderately potent positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of GABAA receptors (GABAARs). Several additional potent GABAAR PAMs  include 2,3-diphenylquinazolin-4(3H)-one (PPQ), 3-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-one (Cl-PPQ), and others (Wang et al. 2020). Interfacial binding sites for cholesterol on GABAA receptors compete with neurosteroids (Lee 2021). GABAAR is inhibited by L-type calcium channel blockers (Das et al. 2004). In in vivo studies, Stigmasterol (0.5-3.0 mg/kg, i.p.) exerted significant anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects in an identical manner to allopregnanolone, indicating the involvement of a GABAergic mechanism. Thus, GABAA receptors are subject to anxiolytic and anticonvulsant activities of stigmasterol. Thus, stigmasterol is a candidate steroidal drug for the treatment of neurological disorders due to its positive modulation of GABA receptors (Karim et al. 2021). Sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpenoids harbor modulatory allosteric properties that affect inhibitoryGABAA receptors (Janzen et al. 2021). High-dose benzodiazepines positively modulate GABAA receptors via a flumazenil-insensitive mechanism (Wang et al. 2021). Benzodiazepine binding to transmembrane anaesthetic binding sites of the GABAA receptor can produce positive or negative modulation manifesting as decreases or increases in locomotion, respectively. Selectivity for these sites may contribute to the distinct GABAA receptor and behavioural actions of different benzodiazepines, particularly at high anaesthetic concentrations (McGrath et al. 2021). (+)-Catharanthine potentiates the GABAA receptor by binding to a transmembrane site at the beta(+)/alpha(-) interface near the TMS2-TMS3 loop (Arias et al. 2022). Diazepam derivatives are allosteric modulators of GABAA receptor alpha1beta2gamma2 subtypes (Djebaili et al. 2022). α1 proline 277 residues regulate GABAAR gating through M2-M3 loop interactions in the interfacial region (Kaczor et al. 2022). Regulated assembly and neurosteroid modulation constrain GABA(A) receptor pharmacology in vivo (Sun et al. 2023). Pathogenic variants of the human GABRA1 gene are associated with epilepsy (Arslan 2023). Resting-state alterations in behavioral 
variant frontotemporal dementia are related to the distribution of 
monoamine and GABA neurotransmitter systems (Hahn et al. 2024). GABA-A receptor changes underpin the antidepressant response to ketamine (Sumner et al. 2024).

84,1.A.9.8.1,Bacteria,Cyanobacteriota,"The prokaryotic H+-gated ion channel, GlvI or GLIC (Bocquet et al., 2007), solved at 2.9 Å resolution in the open pentameric state (3EHZ_E) (Bocquet et al., 2009; Corringer et al","The prokaryotic H+-gated ion channel, GlvI or GLIC (Bocquet et al., 2007), solved at 2.9 Å resolution in the open pentameric state (3EHZ_E) (Bocquet et al., 2009; Corringer et al. 2010). The basis for ion selectivity has been reported (Fritsch et al., 2011). Two stage tilting of the pore lining helices results in channel opening and closing (Zhu and Hummer, 2010). The mechanical work of opening the pore is performed primarily on the M2-M3 loop. Strong interactions of this short and conserved loop with the extracellular domain are therefore crucial to couple ligand binding to channel opening. The H+-activated GLIC has an extracellular domain between TMSs M3 and M4 but lacks the intracellular domain (ICD) which is a distinct folding domain (Goyal et al., 2011). The structural basis for alcohol modulation of GLIC has been reported (Howard et al., 2011).  The structure of the M2 TMS indicates that the charge selectivity filter is in the cytoplasmic half of the channel (Parikh et al. 2011).  Below pH 5.0, GLIC desensitizes on a time scale of minutes. During activation, the extracellular hydrophobic region undergoes changes involving outward translational movement, away from the pore axis, leading to an increase in pore diameter. The lower end of M2 remains relatively immobile (Velisetty et al., 2012). During desensitization, the intervening polar residues in the middle of M2 move closer to form a solvent-occluded barrier and thereby reveal the location of a distinct desensitization gate. In comparison to the crystal structure of GLIC, the structural dynamics of the channel in a membrane environment suggest a more loosely packed conformation with water-accessible intrasubunit vestibules penetrating from the extracellular end all the way to the middle of M2 in the closed-state (Velisetty et al. 2012).  Pore opening and closing is well understood (Zhu and Hummer 2010). X-ray structures of general anaesthetics bound to GLIC revealed a common general-anaesthetic binding site, which pre-exists in the apo-structure in the upper part of the transmembrane domain of each protomer (Nury et al., 2011). Large blockers bind in the center of the membrane, but divalent transition metal ions bind to the narrow intracellular pore entry (Hilf et al., 2010).  Alcohols and anaesthetics induce structural changes and activate ligand-gated ion channels of the LIC family by binding in intersubunit cavities (Sauguet et al. 2013; Ghosh et al. 2013).  Gating at pH 4 has been visualized by x-ray crystallography (Gonzalez-Gutierrez et al. 2013)  Site-directed spin labeling and x-ray analyses have revealed gating transition motions and mechanisms that distinguish active from desensitized states (Dellisanti et al. 2013; Sauguet et al. 2013).  Gating involves major rearrangements of the interfacial loops (Velisetty et al. 2014).  A single point mutation can change the effect of an anesthetic (desfurane; chloroform) from an inhibitor to a potentiator (Brömstrup et al. 2013).  An interhelix hydrogen bond involving His234 is important for stabilization of the open
state (Rienzo et al. 2014).  The outermost M4 TMS makes distinct
contributions to the maturation and gating of the related GLIC and ELIC homologs, suggesting that they exhibit divergent mechanisms of channel function (Hénault et al. 2015).  The same allosteric network may underlie
the actions of various anesthetics, regardless of binding site (Joseph and Mincer 2016). GLIC and ELIC (TC# 1.A.9.9.1) may represent distinct transmembrane domain archetypes (Therien and Baenziger 2017).  Arcario et al. 2017 have demonstrated an anesthetic binding site in GLIC which is accessed through a membrane-embedded tunnel. The anesthetic interacts with a previously known site, resulting in conformational changes that produce a non-conductive state of the channel (Arcario et al. 2017).  The gating mechanism has been studied (Lev et al. 2017). R-Ketamine inhibits members of the LIC family, and the structural and dynamics basis for the assymetric inhibitory modulation of ketamine has been revealed (Ion et al. 2017). Residue E35 has been identified as a key proton-sensing residue, as neutralization of its side chain carboxylate stabilizes the active state. Thus, proton activation occurs allosterically at the level of multiple loci with a key contribution of the coupling interface between the extracellular and transmembrane domains (Nemecz et al. 2017). General anesthetics can allosterically favor closed channels by binding in the pore or favor open channels via various subsites in the transmembrane domain (Fourati et al. 2018). GLIC's gating by protonation proceeds by making use of loop F, already known as an allosteric site in other pLGICs, instead of the classic orthosteric site (Hu et al. 2018). Binding of fentanyl to its binding site within GLIC results in conformational changes that inhibit conduction through the channel (Faulkner et al. 2019). This channel and others have been studied by high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) which has made it possible to characterized the conformational dynamics of single unlabeled transmembrane channels and transporters (Heath and Scheuring 2019). Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels undergo subtle conformational cycling to control electrochemical signal transduction. Lycksell et al. 2021 used small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) to probe ambient solution-phase properties of GLIC under resting and activating conditions. Resting-state GLIC was the best-fit crystal structure to SANS curves, with no evidence for divergent mechanisms. Thus, the findings demonstrate state-dependent changes in a pentameric ion channel by SANS.  A 3-state  model has been proposed; mutations at the subunit interface in the extracellular domain (ECD) principally alter pre-activation, while mutations in the lower ECD and the transmembrane domain principally alter activation. Propofol alters both transitions (Lefebvre et al. 2021). Cryo-EM structures of GLIC under three pH conditions showed that decreased pH is associated with improved resolution and side chain rearrangements at the subunit/domain interface, particularly involving functionally important residues in the beta1-beta2 and M2-M3 loops. Molecular dynamics simulations substantiated flexibility in the closed-channel extracellular domains relative to the transmembrane ones and supported electrostatic remodeling around E35 and E243 in proton-induced gating. Exploration of secondary cryo-EM classes further indicated a low-pH population with an expanded pore (Rovšnik et al. 2021). Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) inhibit pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) by selectively binding to a single site in the outer transmembrane domain of ELIC (Dietzen et al. 2022). Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant and smoking cessation drug which causes adverse effects such as insomnia, irritability, and anxiety. Bupropion inhibits dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake transporters and eukaryotic cation-conducting pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs), such as nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) and serotonin type 3A (5-HT3A) receptors, at clinically relevant concentrations. Pirayesh et al. 2023 examined the inhibitory potency of bupropion in this GLIC). Bupropion inhibited proton- induced currents in GLIC with an inhibitory potency of 14.9 +/- 2.0 muM, comparable to clinically attainable concentrations previously shown to also modulate eukaryotic pLGICs. Using single amino acid substitutions in GLIC and two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings, a binding site for bupropion in the lower third of the first TMS M1 at residue T214. The side chain of M1 T214 together with additional residues of M1 and also of M3 of the adjacent subunit have previously been shown to contribute to binding of other lipophilic molecules like allopregnanolone and pregnanolone (Pirayesh et al. 2023).",{'uptake'},,,,{'24870': 'ion'},{'24870': set()},R_1_A_9_8_1,{'24870': set()}

A 3.3 Å resolution structure is available (Hilf and Dutzler, 2008; Corringer et al., 2010).  X-ray analyses have identified three distinct binding sites for anaesthetics, one in the channel, one at the end of a TMS, and one in a hydrophobic pocket of the extracellular domain (Spurny et al. 2013).  Motions involving desensitization have been defined (Dellisanti et al. 2013).  Simulations indicate the similarities  with and differences between the Acetylcholine receptor (Cheng et al. 2009).  This family includes members with very divergent properties (Gonzalez-Gutierrez and Grosman 2015).  Cysteamine is an agonist for ELIC (Hénault and Baenziger 2016). X-ray structures and
functional measurements support a pore-blocking mechanism for the inhibitory action of short-chain
alcohols which bind to the TMSs (Chen et al. 2016). GLIC (TC# 1.A.9.8.1) and ELIC may represent distinct transmembrane domain archetypes (Therien and Baenziger 2017), and both bind hopenoids at the mamalian cholesterol binding site (Barrantes and Fantini 2016).  A high-resolution structure of ELIC in a lipid-bound state has revealed a phospholipid binding site at the lower half of pore-forming transmembrane helices M1 and M4 and at a nearby site for neurosteroids, cholesterol or general anesthetics (Hénault et al. 2019). This site is shaped by an M4-helix kink and a Trp-Arg-Pro triad that is highly conserved in eukaryote GABAA/C and glycine receptors. M4 is intrinsically flexible, and M4 deletions or disruptions of the lipid-binding site accelerate desensitization, suggesting that lipid interactions shape the agonist response (Hénault et al. 2019). 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol (POPG) stabilizes the open state of ELIC relative to the desensitized state by direct binding to specific sites (Tong et al. 2019). The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor from the Torpedo electric organ, when reconstituted in membranes formed by zwitterionic phospholipids alone, exposure to agonist fails to elicit ion-flux activity, and ELIC has a similar lipid sensitivity. Structures of ELIC in palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine- (POPC-) only nanodiscs in both the unliganded (4.1-Å resolution) and agonist-bound (3.3 Å) states using single-particle cryoEM have been solved (Kumar et al. 2020). The largest differences occur at the level of loop C - at the agonist-binding sites - and the loops at the interface between the extracellular and transmembrane domains (ECD and TMD, respectively). The transmembrane pore is occluded similarly in both structures. POPC-only membranes prevent ECD-TMD coupling so that the ""conformational wave"" of liganded-receptor gating takes place in the ECD and the interfacial M2-M3 linker, but fails to penetrate the membrane and propagate into the TMD. The higher affinity for agonists, characteristic of the open- and desensitized-channel conformations, results from the tighter confinement of the ligand to its binding site; this limits the ligand's fluctuations, and thus delays its escape into bulk solvent (Kumar et al. 2020).",{'uptake'},,,,{'24870': 'ion'},{'24870': set()},R_1_A_9_9_1,{'24870': set()}

Functional characterization shows sTeLIC to be a cationic channel activated at alkaline pH. It is inhibited by divalent cations, but not by quaternary ammonium ions such as tetramethylammonium. Hu et al. 2018 also found that sTeLIC is allosterically potentiated by the aromatic amino acids, Phe and Trp, as well as their derivatives, such as 4-bromo-cinnamate, whose cocrystal structure reveals a vestibular binding site equivalent to, but more deeply buried than, the one already described for benzodiazepines in ELIC.

The protein includes a periplasmic NTD fused
 to the conventional ligand-binding domain (LBD) (Hu et al. 2020). The NTD consists of two jelly-roll domains interacting across each subunit interface. Binding of Ca2+ at the LBD subunit interface is associated with a closed transmembrane 
pore, with resolved monovalent cations intracellular to the hydrophobic 
gate. Accordingly, DeCLIC-injected oocytes conducted currents only upon 
depletion of extracellular Ca2+. DeCLIC crystallized in the absence of Ca2+ with a wide-open pore and remodeled periplasmic domains, including 
increased contacts between the NTD and classic LBD agonist-binding 
sites. Functional, structural, and dynamical properties of DeCLIC 
paralleled those of sTeLIC, a pLGIC from another symbiotic prokaryote. 
Based on these DeCLIC structures, the previous structure of bacterial ELIC (the first high-resolution structure of a pLGIC) should be reclassified as a ""locally closed"" conformation. Structures of DeCLIC in multiple conformations illustrate dramatic conformational state transitions and diverse regulatory mechanisms available to ion channels in pLGICs, particularly involving Ca2+ modulation and periplasmic NTDs (Hu et al. 2020). Ligand-binding affinities are insensitive to binding-site occupancy, and mutations in residues in the transmembrane domain are unlikely to affect the channel's affinities for ligands that bind to the extracellular domain (Godellas and Grosman 2022). Cation-selective pLGICs contain a long helical extension (MA) of one of the transmembrane helices. The MA helix affects both the membrane expression of, and ion conductance levels through, these pLGICs. In fact, the MA helix Is important for receptor assembly and function in the alpha4beta2 nACh receptor (Fricska et al. 2023).",{'uptake'},,,,"{'24870': 'ion', '25414': 'monoatomic monocation'}","{'24870': set(), '25414': set()}",R_1_A_9_9_3,"{'24870': set(), '25414': set()}"

The activity and high resolution 3-d structure have been determined (Chang et al. 2014). BsYetJ in lipid nanodiscs is structurally different from those crystallized in detergents. Li et al. 2020 showed that the BsYetJ conformation is pH-sensitive in the apo state (lacking calcium), whereas in a calcium-containing solution, it is stuck in an intermediate state, inert to pH changes. Only when the transmembrane calcium gradient is established can the calcium-release activity of holo-BsYetJ occur and be mediated by pH-dependent conformational changes, suggesting a dual gating mechanism. Conformational substates involved in the process and a key residue, D171, relevant to the gating of calcium were identified. Thus, BsYetJ/TMBIM6 is a pH-dependent, voltage-gated calcium channel (Li et al. 2020). The transmembrane BAX inhibitor-1-containing motif 6 (TMBIM6) protein may modulate apoptosis by regulating calcium homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Lan et al. 2023 investigated all negatively charged residues in BsYetJ, a bacterial homolog of TMBIM6. They reconstituted BsYetJ in membrane vesicles with a lipid composition similar to that of the ER. The charged residues E49 and R205 work together as a major gate, regulating calcium conductance in these ER-like lipid vesicles. However, these residues become largely inactive when reconstituted in other lipid environments. D195 acts as a minor filter compared to the E49-R205 dyad (Lan et al. 2023).",{'uptake'},,,,{'3308': 'calcium(2+)'},{'3308': {'ca2'}},R_1_A_14_2_3,{'3308': set()}

It catalyzes bidirectional transport, has a pentameric aquaporin-like (TC# 1.A.8) structure, and may function by a channel-type mechanism (Falke et al., 2009; Wang et al. 2009). The structure at 2.25 Å resolution has been determined (Wang et al., 2009).  The protein is encoded in an operon with pyruvate-formate lyase, PflB.  A pyruvate:formate antiport mechanism has been suggested (Moraes and Reithmeier 2012). The C-terminal 6 aas are required for formate transport, but not for homopentamer formation (Hunger et al. 2017).  The N-terminus of FocA interacts with PflB, and this interaction is essential for 
optimal formate translocation (Doberenz et al. 2014). In fact, the GREs, TdcE and PflB, interact with the FNT channel protein, probably to control formate translocation by FocA (Falke et al. 2016). The lipophilic constrictions of FocA mainly act as barriers to isolate the central histidine from the aqueous bulk, preventing protonation via proton wires. Thus, an FNT transport model is supported in which the central histidine is uncharged, and weak acid substrate anion protonation occurs in the vestibule regions of the transporter before passing the constrictions (Schmidt and Beitz 2021). An interplay between the conserved pore residues Thr-91 and His-209 controls formate translocation through the FocA channel (Kammel et al. 2022). T91 is essential for formate permeation in both directions; however, it is particularly important to allow anion efflux. H209 is essential for formate uptake by FocA, strongly suggesting that protonation-deprotonation of this residue plays a role in formate uptake. These observations substantiate the premise that efflux and influx of formate by FocA are mechanistically distinct processes that are controlled by the interplay between T91 and H209 (Kammel et al. 2022).","{'secretion', 'uptake'}",,,,{},{},R_1_A_16_1_1,{}

 a proton-selective ion channel that is necessary for the efficient

cell surface, the virion enters the cell by endocytosis. Acidification 
of the endosome triggers M2 ion channel activity. The influx of protons 
into the virion interior is believed to disrupt interactions between the 
viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP), matrix protein 1 (M1), and lipid 
bilayers, thereby freeing the viral genome from interaction with viral 
proteins and enabling RNA segments to migrate to the host cell nucleus, 
where influenza virus RNA transcription and replication occur. Also 
plays a role in viral proteins secretory pathway.

Residues in the putative primary gate are present in the first TMS (Levin and Blount 2004). Protein-lipid interactions are important for gating, dependent on TMS tilting (Iscla et al., 2011b).  The carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic helices assemble into a pentameric bundle
that resembles cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, and these are required for the selective formation of the pentamer (Ando et al. 2015). Lysophospholipids can increase the size of particles that can be transported (Foo et al. 2015). 500 - 700 channels are needed for 80% survival follwing a large changes in osmotic pressure, a number of channels similar to that found in wild type E. coli cells (Chure et al. 2018). its activation threshold decreases with membrane thickness; the membrane-thickness-dependent MscL opening mainly arises from structural changes in MscL to match the altered membrane thickness by stretching (Katsuta et al. 2018). MscL can provide a route for antibiotic entry into the E. coli cell, and agonists are available to facilitate their entry (Wray et al. 2020; Zhao et al. 2020). MscL has been used to design a synthetic mechanosensitive signaling pathway in compartmentalized artificial cells (Hindley et al. 2019). Available information at the ultrastructural level on lipids tightly bound to transport proteins and the impact of altered bulk membrane lipid composition has been reviewed (Stieger et al. 2021). Competition between hydrophobic mismatch and tension may result in opening tension for MscL (Wiggins and Phillips 2004).",{'secretion'},,,,"{'24870': 'ion', '25728': 'osmolyte'}","{'24870': set(), '25728': set()}",R_1_A_22_1_1,"{'24870': set(), '25728': set()}"

Seven residues, mostly hydrophobic, in the first and second transmembrane helices are lipid-sensing residues (Malcolm et al., 2011).  X-ray structures are available (Lai et al. 2013).  The cytoplasmic cage domain senses macromolecular crowding (Rowe et al. 2014). A gating mechanism has been proposed (Malcolm et al. 2015).  The thermodynamics of K+ leak have been studied (Koprowski et al. 2015).  In the
MscS crystal structure (PDB 2OAU ), a narrow, hydrophobic opening is visible in
the crystal structure, and a vapor lock, created by hydrophobic seals consisting of
L105 and L109, is the barrier to water and ions (Rasmussen et al. 2015). The voltage dependence of inactivation occurs
independently of the positive charges of R46, R54, and R74 (Nomura et al. 2016). The closed-to-open transition may involve rotation and tilt of the pore-lining helices (Edwards et al. 2005). A molecular dynamics study of gating has been published (Sotomayor and Schulten 2004).
 It suggested that when restraining the backbone of the protein, the 
channel remained in the open form and the simulation revealed 
intermittent permeation of water molecules through the channel. 
Abolishing the restraints under constant pressure conditions led to 
spontaneous closure of the transmembrane channel, whereas abolishing the
 restraints when surface tension (20 dyn/cm) was applied led to channel 
widening. The large balloon-shaped cytoplasmic domain of MscS exhibited 
spontaneous diffusion of ions through its side openings. Interaction 
between the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic domain of MscS was 
observed and involved formation of salt bridges between residues Asp62 
and Arg128; this interaction may be essential for the gating of MscS. K+ and Cl- ions showed distinctively different distributions in and around the channel (Sotomayor and Schulten 2004).",{'uptake'},,,,{'24870': 'ion'},{'24870': set()},R_1_A_23_2_1,{'24870': set()}

resolution of 13 A (Böttcher et al. 2015). While the cytosolic vestibule is structurally similar to that in MscS,
additional density is seen in the transmembrane region, consistent with the presence of two
additional TMSs predicted for YnaI. The location of this density suggests that the extra TMSs are tilted, which could induce local membrane curvature extending the tension-sensing
paddles seen in MscS. Off-center lipid-accessible cavities are seen that resemble gaps between the
sensor paddles in MscS. The conservation of the tapered shape and the cavities in YnaI suggest a
mechanism similar to that of MscS (Böttcher et al. 2015). The voltage dependence of inactivation occurs
independently of the positive charges of R46, R54, and R74 (Nomura et al. 2016). A 3.8 Å structure by cryoEM revealed a heptamer structural fold similar to previously studied MscS channels. The ion-selective filter is formed by seven hydrophobic methionines (Met158) in the transmembrane pore (Yu et al. 2017). Details of the gating transition for MscS have been predicted (Zhu et al. 2018). YnaI has a gating mechanism based on flexible pore helices (Flegler et al. 2020), and thus, MscS-like channels of different sizes have a common core architecture but show different gating mechanisms and fine-tuned conductive properties.

The structure reveals a homodimer with the channel at the interface of the two subunits.  There is a plug helix connecting the two domains, and the cytoplasmic domain possesses multiple Mg2+ binding sites at the cytoplasmic face that can bind Mg2+, Mn2+ and Ca2+.

190,1.A.30.1.1,Bacteria,Pseudomonadota,The flagellar motor  (pmf-dependent) (MotA-MotB),"The flagellar motor  (pmf-dependent) (MotA-MotB). TMSs 3 and 4 of MotA and the single TMS of MotB comprise the proton channel, which is inactive until the complex assembles into a motor. Hosking et al. 2006 identify a periplasmic segment of the MotB protein that acts as a plug to prevent premature proton flow. The plug is in the periplasm just C-terminal to the MotB TMS flanked by Pro52 and Pro65. The Pro residues and Ile58, Tyr61, and Phe62 are essential for plug function (Hosking et al. 2006).
The mechanism of proton passage and coupling to flagellar rotation has been proposed (Nishihara and Kitao 2015).  About
a dozen MotA/B complexes are anchored to the peptidoglycan layer around the motor through the
C-terminal peptidoglycan-binding domain of MotB (Castillo et al. 2013). Dynamic permeation by hydronium ions, sodium ions, and water molecules has been observed using steered molecular dynamics simulations, and free energy profiles for ion/water permeation were calculated (Kitao and Nishihara 2017). They also examined the possible ratchet motion of the cytoplasmic domain induced by the protonation/deprotonation cycle of the MotB proton binding site, Asp32. The motor (MotAB) consists of a dynamic population of mechanosensitive stators that are embedded in the inner membrane and activate in response to external load. This entails assembly around the rotor, anchoring to the peptidoglycan layer to counteract torque from the rotor and opening of a cation channel to facilitate an influx of cations, which is converted into mechanical rotation. Stator complexes are comprised of four copies of an integral membrane A subunit and two copies of a B subunit. Each B subunit includes a C-terminal OmpA-like peptidoglycan-binding (PGB) domain. This is thought to be linked to a single N-terminal transmembrane helix by a long unstructured peptide, which allows the PGB domain to bind to the peptidoglycan layer during stator anchoring. The high-resolution crystal structures of flagellar motor PGB domains from Salmonella enterica have been solved (Liew et al. 2017). Change in the C ring conformation for switching and rotation involve loose and tight intersubunit interactions (Sakai et al. 2019).",{'uptake'},,,,"{'5584': 'hydron', '24636': 'proton'}","{'5584': {'h'}, '24636': {'h'}}",R_1_A_30_1_1,"{'5584': set(), '24636': set()}"

PomB interacts with the third TMS of PomA in the Na+-driven polar flagellum (Yakushi et al. 2004). Sodium-powered stators of the flagellar motor can generate torque in the presence of the sodium channel blocker, phenamil, with mutations near the peptidoglycan-binding region of PomB (Ishida et al. 2019). FliL associates with the flagellar stator in the sodium-driven Vibrio motor (Lin et al. 2018). When the ion channel is closed, PomA and PomB interact strongly. When the ion channel opens, PomA interacts less tightly with PomB. The plug and loop between TMSs 1 and 2 regulate activation of the stator, which depends on the binding of sodium ion to the D24 residue of PomB (Nishikino et al. 2019). The PomA helices parallel to the inner membrane play roles in the hoop-like function in securing the stability of the stator complex and the ion conduction pathway (Nishikino et al. 2022). Na+-binding sites are formed by critical aspartic acid and threonine residues located in the TMSs of PomAB (Kojima et al. 2023). Vibrio alginolyticus forms a single flagellum at its cell pole. FlhF and FlhG are the main proteins responsible for the polar formation of the single flagellum. MS-ring formation in the flagellar basal body appears to be an initiation step for flagellar assembly. The MS-ring is formed by a single protein, FliF, which has two transmembrane (TM) segments and a large periplasmic region. FlhF is required for the polar localization of Vibrio FliF, and FlhF facilitated MS-ring formation when FliF was overexpressed in E. coli cells. These results suggest that FlhF interacts with FliF to facilitate MS-ring formation. Fukushima et al. 2023 detected this interaction using Vibrio FliF fragments fused to a tag of Glutathione S-transferase (GST) in E. coli. The N-terminal 108 residues of FliF, including the first TMS and the periplasmic region, could pull FlhF down. In the first step, Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) and its receptor are involved in the transport of membrane proteins to target them, which delivers them to the translocon. FlhF may have a similar or enhanced function as SRP, which binds to a region rich in hydrophobic residues (Fukushima et al. 2023).",{'uptake'},,,,{'9175': 'sodium(1+)'},{'9175': {'na1'}},R_1_A_30_1_2,{'9175': set()}

The CorA monomer has a C-terminal membrane domain containing two transmembrane segments and a large N-terminal cytoplasmic soluble domain. In the membrane, CorA forms a homopentamer shaped like a funnel which binds fully hydrated Mg2+ in the periplasm (Maguire 2006). A ring of positive charges are external to the ion-conduction pathway at the cytosolic membrane interface, and highly negatively charged helices in the cytosolic domain  appear to interact with the ring of positive charge to facilitate Mg2+ entry. Mg2+ ions are present in the cytosolic domain that are well placed to control the interaction of the ring of positive charge and the negatively charged helices, and thus, control Mg2+ entry (Maguire 2006).  Gating is achieved by helical rotation upon the binding of a metal ion
 substrate to the regulatory binding sites. The preference  for Co2+ over Mg2+ has been reported to be determined by the presence of threonine side chains in the channel (Nordin et al. 2013), but more recently, Kowatz and Maguire 2018 showed that Co2+ is not a substrate, and that the intersubunit bound Mg2+ is not required for function and does not control the open versus closed states.",{'uptake'},,,,"{'6635': 'magnesium(2+)', '23337': 'cobalt(2+)'}","{'6635': {'mg2'}, '23337': {'cobalt2'}}",R_1_A_35_3_2,"{'6635': set(), '23337': set()}"

of these channels. Each trimer subunit consists of seven TMSs with two inverted 3 TMS repeats (Silverio and Saier 2011).
 The electrophysiological, biochemical and
biophysical analyses revealed that TRIC channels possess an 
ion-conducting pore within each subunit,
and that trimer formation contributes to the stability of the protein. 
The symmetrically related
TMS2 and TMS5 helices are kinked at conserved glycine clusters, and 
these kinks are important for channel activity. The kinks in TMS2 and 
TMS5 generate lateral
fenestrations at each subunit interface that are occupied by lipid 
molecules (Kasuya et al. 2016).",{'uptake'},,,,{'3308': 'calcium(2+)'},{'3308': {'ca2'}},R_1_A_62_2_4,{'3308': set()}

281,1.A.72.1.1,Bacteria,Pseudomonadota,The MerF mercuric ion uptake transporter of 81 aas and 2 TMSs,"The MerF mercuric ion uptake transporter of 81 aas and 2 TMSs. The NMR structure of the helix-loop-helix core domain of MerF has been determined with a backbone RMSD of 0.58 Å (Howell et al. 2005). Moreover, the fold of this polypeptide demonstrates that the two vicinal pairs of cysteine residues, shown to be involved in the transport of Hg++ across the membrane, are exposed to the cytoplasm. This finding differs from earlier structural and mechanistic models that were based primarily on the somewhat atypical hydropathy plot for MerF and related transport proteins (Howell et al. 2005). The apo state positions one of the cysteine pairs closer to the periplasmic side of the membrane, while in the bound state, the same pair approaches the cytoplasmic side (Hwang et al. 2019). This is consistent with the functional requirement of accepting Hg2+ from the periplasmic space, sequestering it on acceptance, and transferring it to the cytoplasm. Conformational changes in the TMSs facilitate the functional interaction of the two cysteine pairs. Free-energy calculations provide a barrier of 16 kcal/mol for the association of the periplasmic Hg2+-bound protein, MerP, with MerF, and 7 kcal/mol for the subsequent association of MerF's two cysteine pairs (Hwang et al. 2019).",{'uptake'},,,,{'5714': 'mercury(2+)'},{'5714': {'hg2'}},R_1_A_72_1_1,{'5714': set()}

In this case, mutation of His72 rendered the host cells less CdCl2 sensitive, whereas none of the Cys residues affected it. E. coli cells expressing a merC-deletion mutant, in which the coding-sequence of the carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic region was removed, retained Hg2+ hypersensitivity and showed about 55% HgCl2 uptake ability compared to that of the one expressing the intact merC, indicating that this region is not essential for Hg2+ uptake. Coexpression of the A. ferrooxidans gene encoding mercuric reductase (merA) and the merC deletion mutation conferred HgCl2 tolerance to E. coli host cells. Under this condition, the merC deletion gene product was exclusively present as a monomer (Sasaki et al. 2005).",{'uptake'},,,,{'5714': 'mercury(2+)'},{'5714': {'hg2'}},R_1_A_72_4_2,{'5714': set()}

The architecture represents a completely different fold from that of canonical K+ channels. All six transmembrane helices of CmTMEM175 are tightly packed within each subunit without undergoing domain swapping. The highly conserved TMS1 helix acts as the pore-lining inner helix, creating an hourglass-shaped ion permeation pathway in the channel tetramer.

Mutagenesis analyses suggested that the first layer of the highly conserved isoleucine residues in the filter is primarily responsible for channel selectivity.

It transports cadaverine and putrescine.  In fact, Salmonella, Klebsiella pneumoniae (TC# 1.A.112.1.12) and E. coli synthesize, import, and export cadaverine, 
putrescine, and spermidine to maintain physiological levels of polyamines and provide 
pH homeostasis. Both low and high intracellular levels of polyamines 
confer pleiotropic phenotypes or lethality. Iwadate et al. 2021 demonstrated that PaeA (YtfL) is 
required for reducing cytoplasmic cadaverine and putrescine 
concentrations. PaeA is involved in stationary 
phase survival when cells are grown in acidic medium in 
which they produce cadaverine. The paeA mutant is sensitive to 
putrescine, but not spermidine or spermine. Sensitivity to external 
cadaverine in stationary phase is only observed at pH > 8, suggesting
 that the polyamines need to be deprotonated to passively diffuse into 
the cell. In the absence of PaeA, intracellular polyamine 
levels increase and the cells lose viability. Ectopic expression of 
the known cadaverine exporter, CadB, in stationary phase partially 
suppresses the paeA mutant phenotype, and overexpression of paeA in exponential
 phase partially complements a cadB mutant grown in acidic medium. Thus, PaeA is a cadaverine/putrescine 
exporter, reducing potentially toxic levels under certain stress 
conditions (Iwadate et al. 2021).",{'uptake'},,,,"{'8650': 'putrescine', '3288': 'cadaverine'}","{'8650': {'ptrc'}, '3288': {'15dap'}}",R_1_A_112_2_11,"{'8650': set(), '3288': set()}"

428,1.B.1.1.1,Bacteria,Pseudomonadota,OmpF general porin,"OmpF general porin. OmpF can deliver peptides of >6 KDa (epitopes) including protamine, through the pore lumen from the periplasm to the outside (Housden et al., 2010; Ghale et al. 2014).  For cephalosporin antibiotics, the interaction strength series is ceftriaxone > cefpirome > ceftazidime (Lovelle et al. 2011).  An unfolded protein such as colicin E9 can thread through OmpF from the outside to reach the periplasm (Housden et al. 2013).  Polynucleotides can pass through OmpF (Hadi-Alijanvand and Rouhani 2015). LPS influences the movement of bulk ions (K+ and 
Cl-), but the ion selectivity of OmpF is mainly affected by bulk ion 
concentrations (Patel et al. 2016).  OMPs such as OmpF cluster into islands that restrict their lateral mobility, while IMPs generally diffuse throughout the cell. Rassam et al. 2018 demonstrated that when transient, energy-dependent transmembrane connections are formed, IMPs become subjugated by the inherent organisation of OMPs, and that such connections impact IMP function. They showed that while establishing a translocon for import, colicin ColE9 sequesters the IMPs of the proton motive force (PMF)-linked Tol-Pal complex into islands mirroring those of colicin-bound OMPs. Through this imposed organisation, the bacteriocin subverts the outer-membrane stabilizing role of Tol-Pal, blocking its recruitment to cell division sites and slowing membrane constriction. The ordering of IMPs by OMPs via an energised inter-membrane bridge represents an emerging functional paradigm in cell envelope biology (Rassam et al. 2018). Colicin E9 (ColE9) disordered regions exploit OmpF for direction-specific 
binding, which ensures the constrained presentation of an activating 
signal within the bacterial periplasm (Housden et al. 2018). Anionic lipid binding can prevent closure of OmpF channels, thereby increasing access of antibiotics that use porin-mediated pathways (Liko et al. 2018). OmpF may be the major route of D-lactate/D-3-hydroxybutyrate oligo-ester secretion (Utsunomia et al. 2017). Lipid Headgroup Charge and Acyl Chain Composition Modulate Closure of the channel (Perini et al. 2019). Piperacillin, tazobactam, ampicillin and sulbactam interact strongly with OmpF, and may be transported (Wang et al. 2019). Gating kinetics are governed by lipid characteristics so that each stage 
of a sequential closure is different from the previous one, probably 
because of intra- or intermonomeric rearrangements (Perini et al. 2019). OmpF transports fosfomycin (Golla et al. 2019) and bacteriocins  into cells. Polypeptide transport/binding processes generate an essentially irreversible, hook-like assembly that constrains an import activating peptide epitope between two subunits of the OmpF trimer (Lee et al. 2020). Physical properties of bacterial porins (OmpF and OmpC) match environmental conditionsof induction (Milenkovic et al. 2023). Enrofloxacin caused blockage of ion current through OmpF, depending on the side of addition to the assymetic bilayer containing lipopolysaccharide and the transmembrane voltage applied (Donoghue et al. 2023).",{'uptake'},,,,"{'24870': 'ion', '7990': 'peptide', '3503': 'cefpirome', '29007': 'ceftriaxone', '3508': 'ceftazidime'}","{'24870': set(), '7990': set(), '3503': set(), '29007': set(), '3508': set()}",R_1_B_1_1_1,"{'24870': set(), '7990': set(), '3503': set(), '29007': set(), '3508': set()}"

Its expression is dependent on small single TMS membrane proteins which are encoded in a single operon with it (Veyron-Churlet et al., 2011). The rv0899 gene, encoding OmpATb, is part of an operon (rv0899-rv0901) that is required for fast ammonia secretion, pH neutralization, and growth of M. tuberculosis in acidic environments (Song et al. 2011). Homologues are widespread in bacteria with functions in nitrogen metabolism, adaptation to nutrient poor environments, and/or establishing symbiosis with host organisms (Marassi, 2011). The high resolution 3-d structure is known, revealing two independent domains separated by a proline-rich hinge region.The C-terminal domain (OmpATb(198-326))
 revealed a module structurally related to other OmpA-like proteins from
 Gram-negative bacteria, but the N-terminal domain(73-204), which  forms channels in planar lipid 
bilayers, exhibits a fold, which belongs to the α+β sandwich class fold. It exists in a major monomeric form and a

to explain its selective promiscuity (Grinter and Lithgow 2019). The structural data, in 
combination with functional analysis, showed that FhuE has evolved to specifically engage with planar siderophores. A 
potential evolutionary driver, and a critical consequence of this 
selectivity, is that it allows FhuE to exclude antibiotics that mimic nonplanar hydroxamate siderophores.  These toxic molecules could otherwise cross the outer membrane barrier

lipoprotein, lactoferrin-binding protein B (LbpB) is homologous

Moraxella bovis. Docking the LbpB  with lactoferrin reveals 
extensive binding interactions with the N1 subdomain of lactoferrin. The
 nature of the interaction precludes apolactoferrin from binding LbpB, 
ensuring the specificity for iron-loaded lactoferrin, safeguarding proper delivery of iron-bound lactoferrin to the 
transporter LbpA. The structure also 
reveals a possible secondary role for LbpB in protecting the bacteria from host defences. Following 
proteolytic digestion of lactoferrin, a cationic peptide derived from 
the N-terminus is released. This peptide, called lactoferricin, exhibits
 potent antimicrobial effects. The docked model of LbpB with lactoferrin

extracellular substrate binding site are allosterically coupled (bidirectional), and TonB binding may
initiate a partial round of transport (Sikora et al. 2016).  Substrate binding to the extracellular surface of the protein triggers the unfolding of an energy
coupling motif at the periplasmic surface.  Thus, substrate binding reduces the interaction free
energy between certain residues, thereby triggering the unfolding of the energy coupling motif (Lukasik et al. 2007). Multiple extracellular loops contribute to substrate binding and transport by BtuB (Fuller-Schaefer and Kadner 2005).",{'uptake'},,,,{'17439': 'cyanocob(III)alamin'},{'17439': set()},R_1_B_14_3_1,{'17439': set()}

Functionally important conserved motifs have been identified (Delattre et al., 2010).  The x-ray structure reveals a beta-barrel pore obstructed by two structural elements conserved in all two partner secretion systems, an N-terminal α-helix and an extracellular loop.  FhaC goes from the closed to the open state in the presence of the filamentous
haemagglutinin adhesin, FHA.  The N-terminal α-helix is displaced into the periplasm during FHA secretion (Guérin et al. 2014).  With two POTRA domains in
the periplasm, a transmembrane beta barrel and a large loop harboring a functionally important
motif, FhaC epitomizes the conserved features of the superfamily (Jacob-Dubuisson et al. 2009). The conserved secretion domain of FHA interacts with the
POTRA domains, specific extracellular loops and strands of FhaC and the inner beta-barrel surface.
The interaction map indicates a funnel-like pathway, with conformationally flexible FHA entering the
channel in a non-exclusive manner and exiting along a four-stranded beta-sheet at the surface of the
FhaC barrel. This sheet of FhaC guides the secretion domain of FHA along discrete steps of
translocation and folding (Baud et al. 2014).  The membrane-proximal POTRA domain exists in several
conformations, and the binding of FHA displaces this equilibrium (Guérin et al. 2015). TpsB (Two Partner Secretion) transporters belong to the Omp85 or OMPPI superfamily, whose members 
catalyze protein insertion into, or translocation across membranes. They are composed of a transmembrane β 
barrel preceded by two periplasmic POTRA domains that bind the incoming 
protein substrate. Sicoli et al. 2022 detected minor states in 
heterogeneous populations, identifying transient conformers of FhaC. This revealed substantial, spontaneous conformational 
changes on a slow time scale, with parts of the POTRA2 domain 
approaching the lipid bilayer and the protein's surface loops. An amphipathic POTRA2 β hairpin
 inserts into the β barrel, and these motions enlarge the 
channel to initiate substrate secretion. This shows how TpsB transporters mediate protein secretion without 
the need for cofactors, by utilizing intrinsic protein dynamics (Sicoli et al. 2022).",{'secretion'},,,,{'14911': 'protein'},{'14911': set()},R_1_B_20_1_6,{'14911': set()}

Encoded by a gene in a gene cluster also encoding an ABC sugar uptake system (TC# 3.A.1.1.46), a glucosyl hydrolase and two oxidoreductases.  Therefore it's phsiological function may be glucoside uptake. At neutral/high pH, the channel is open and 
permeable to substrates of size up to 900Da. At acidic pH,
 loop L6 folds across the channel and blocks the pore. The channel 
blockage at acidic pH appears to be triggered by the protonation of a 
histidine pair on neighboring β-strands, which repel one another, 
resulting in the rearrangement of loop L6 and channel closure (Köster et al. 2015).  Crystallization and analysis by electron microscopy 
and X-ray crystallography revealed the fundamental mechanisms essential 
for channel activity.  A 28 aa extension has been added to the 14 β-TMS barrel to make a 16 β-TMS barrel with normal activity and stability but differing pH sensitivity (Korkmaz et al. 2015). A minimized OmpG porin of only 220 aas still exhibits gating, but it was 5-fold less frequent than in native OmpG. The residual gating of the minimal pore is independent of L6 rearrangements and involves narrowing of the
 ion conductance pathway, most probably driven by global 
stretching-flexing deformations of the membrane-embedded β-barrel (Grosse et al. 2014).  pH-dependent gating is controlled by an electrostatic 
interaction network formed between the gating loop and charged residues 
in the lumen (Perez-Rathke et al. 2018). 3-d structures of the protein in lipid bilayers have been solved (Retel et al. 2017). OmpG may provide a route for D-lactate/D-3-hydroxybutyrate oligo-ester secretion as well as sugar uptake (Utsunomia et al. 2017). OmpG lacks a central constriction  and has an exceptionally wide 
pore diameter of about 13 Å. The equatorial plane of OmpG harbors an 
annulus of four alternating basic and acidic patches, and manipulation of charge distribution in the arginine and glutamate 
clusters alters sugar specificity and ion selectivity (Schmitt et al. 2019).",{'uptake'},,,,{'25367': 'molecule'},{'25367': set()},R_1_B_21_1_1,{'25367': set()}

YaeT (BamA) may serve as an outer membrane ""receptor"" for the CdiA/CdiB 2-partner secretion system that mediates direct cell-cell contact-dependent growth inhibition (Aoki et al., 2008). High-resolution structures of crystal forms of BamA POTRA4-5 from E. coli has been reported (Zhang et al., 2011; Sinnige et al. 2014). Solid-state NMR on BamA, a large multidomain integral membrane protein, revealed dynamic conformational states (Renault et al., 2011). In contrast to the N-terminal periplasmic polypeptide-transport-associated (POTRA) domains, the C-terminal transmembrane β-barrel domain of BamA is mechanically much more stable. Exposed to mechanical stress, this β-barrel stepwise unfolds β-hairpins until unfolding has been completed. The mechanical stabilities of β-barrel and β-hairpins are thereby modulated by the POTRA domains, the membrane composition and the extracellular lid closing the β-barrel. The NMR structure of SmpA (OmlA) is also known (Vanini et al. 2006).  The periplasmic region of BamA is firmly
attached to the β-barrel and does not experience fast global motion around the angle between
POTRA 2 and 3, but the barrel is flexible (Sinnige et al. 2014).  It appears that the BAM complex does not catalyze insertion and assembly of all out membrane (α- and β-)porins (Dunstan et al. 2015).  YfgL shows significant sequence similarity (e-9) with YxaL/K of Bacillus subtilis. The E. coli periplasmic chaperones, Skp and SurA, and BamA, the central subunit of the BAM complex, have been examined with respect to the folding kinetics of a model OMP (tOmpA) (Schiffrin et al. 2017), showing that prefolded BamA promotes the release of tOmpA from Skp, despite the nM affinity of the Skp for tOmpA. This activity is located in the BamA β-barrel domain, but is greater when full-length BamA is present, indicating that both the beta-barrel and POTRA domains are required for maximal activity. By contrast, SurA is unable to release tOmpA from Skp, providing direct evidence against a sequential chaperone model. BamA has a greater catalytic effect on tOmpA folding in thicker bilayers, suggesting that BAM catalysis involves lowering the kinetic barrier imposed by the hydrophobic thickness of the membrane (Schiffrin et al. 2017). While BamA is the primary translocator, TamB is involved in folding and maturation of autotransporters (Babu et al. 2018).",{'uptake'},,,,{'8526': 'protein polypeptide chain'},{'8526': set()},R_1_B_33_1_3,{'8526': set()}

The 2.3 Å crystal structure is known revealing that the barrel is closed by a lid-loop (Gruss et al. 2013).  The
 C-terminal β-strand of the barrel forms an unusual inward kink, which 
weakens the lateral barrel wall and creates a gate for substrate access 
to the lipid bilayer.  TamA is an Omp85 homologue that may function in autotransporter biogenesis together with TamB (TC# 1.B.22.1.2) and OMP85 (Selkrig et al. 2012). The TAM complex likely evolved from an original combination of BamA and TamB, with a later gene duplication event of BamA, giving rise to an additional Omp85 sequence that evolved to be TamA in Proteobacteria and TamL in Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi (Heinz et al. 2015). Possibly TamB nucleates folding of the passenger domain while TamA/B-BamA interact to catalyze β-domain membrane insertion and pore enlargement to facilitate translocation of partially folded autotransporters (M.

LptDE (1:1 stoichiometry) comprise a two-protein β-barrel-lipoprotein complex in the outer membrane that assembles and exports LPS (Chng et al., 2010).  After LPS (or a precursor) is transported across the inner membrane by MsbA (3.A.1.106.1), this seven component system translocates LPS from the outer surface of the inner membrane to the outer surface of the outer membrane using ATP hydrolysis to sequentially energize transfer from one binding site to another in several steps (Freinkman et al. 2012; Okuda et al. 2012; Sherman et al. 2014).  LPS interacts with LptC and LptA sequentially before being passed to the LptD outer membrane porin, anchored by the LptE lipoprotein on the inner surface of the outer membrane.  LptF and LptG are the transmembrane consituents of the ABC pump, and LptB is the ATPase of an ABC-like system that energizes the transport using several ATP molecules (Okuda et al. 2012;  Sherman et al. 2014).  LptC interconnects the LptBFG ABC system with the periplasmic LptA protein via its large periplasmic domain (Villa et al. 2013).  LptDE form a complex in the outer membrane which inserts LPS into this membrane.  The 3-D strcture of the complex shows that the LptE lipoprotein inserts into the 26 stranded barrel of LptD as a plug.  The first two strands of LptD contain prolines and are therefore distorted, possibly creating a portal for lateral diffusion of LPS into the outer leaflet of the outer membrane (Qiao et al. 2014).  The 3-d structure of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa LptA, LptH, has been solved at 2:75 Å resolution revealing a β-jellyroll fold similar to that in LptD (Bollati et al. 2015). Direct interaction of LptB and LptC has been demonstrated (Martorana et al. 2016). A specific binding site in the LptB ATPase for the coupling helices of the transmembrane LptFG complex 
is responsible for coupling ATP hydrolysis by LptB with LptFG 
function to achieve LPS extraction (Simpson et al. 2016). After biosynthesis, bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are transiently anchored to the outer leaflet of the inner membrane (IM). The ABC transporter LptB2FG extracts LPSs from the IM and transports them to the outer membrane. Luo et al. 2017 reported the crystal structure of nucleotide-free LptB2FG from P. aeruginosa. It shows that LPS transport proteins LptF and LptG each contain a TM domain (TMD), a periplasmic beta-jellyroll-like domain and a coupling helix that interacts with LptB on the cytoplasmic side. The LptF and LptG TMDs form a large outward-facing V-shaped cavity in the IM. Mutational analyses suggested that LPS may enter the central cavity laterally, via the interface of the TMD domains of LptF and LptG, and is expelled into the beta-jellyroll-like domains upon ATP binding and hydrolysis by LptB. These studies suggest a mechanism for LPS extraction by LptB2FG that is distinct from those of classical ABC transporters that transport substrates across the IM (Luo et al. 2017). Transport involves a stable association between the inner (LptBFG) and outer  (LptDE)
membrane components, supporting a mechanism in which 
lipopolysaccharide molecules are pushed one after the other across a protein bridge (LptCA) that connects the inner 
and outer membranes (Sherman et al. 2018).  The ABC transporter, LptB2FG, which tightly associates with LptC, extracts lipopolysaccharide out of the inner membrane.Li et al. 2019 characterized the structures of LptB2FG and LptB2FGC in nucleotide-free and vanadate-trapped states, using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. These structures resolve the bound lipopolysaccharide, reveal transporter-lipopolysaccharide interactions with side-chain details and uncover how the capture and extrusion of lipopolysaccharide are coupled to conformational rearrangements of LptB2FGC. LptC inserts its TMS between the two transmembrane domains of LptB2FG, which represents a previously unknown regulatory mechanism for ABC transporters. These results suggest a role for LptC in achieving efficient lipopolysaccharide transport, by coordinating the action of LptB2FG in the inner membrane and Lpt protein interactions in the periplasm (Li et al. 2019). cryo-EM structures of LptB2FG alone and complexed with LptC are known, revealing conformational changes between these states. Two functional transmembrane arginine-containing loops interact with bound AMP-PNP which induces an inward rotation and shift of the transmembrane helices of LptFG and LptC to tighten the cavity, with the closure of two lateral gates, to eventually expel LPS into the bridge (Tang et al. 2019). The ABC transporter, LptB2FGC extracts LPS from the inner membrane and places it onto a periplasmic protein bridge. Lundstedt et al. 2020 showed that residue E86 of LptB is essential for coupling the function of this ATPase to that of its membrane partners, LptFG, at the step where ATP binding drives the closure of the LptB dimer and the collapse of the LPS-binding cavity in LptFG that moves LPS to the Lpt periplasmic bridge consisting of LptC, A and D (from inside to out) and then to the outer membrane insertase, LptE. Defects caused by changing residue E86 are suppressed by mutations altering either the LPS structure or TMSs in LptG. These suppressors fix defects in the coupling helix of LptF, but not of LptG. These observations support a transport mechanism in which the ATP-driven movements of LptB and those of the substrate-binding cavity in LptFG are bi-directionally coordinated through the rigid-body coupling, with LptF's coupling helix being important in coordinating cavity collapse with LptB dimerization (Lundstedt et al. 2020). The TMS of LptC participates in LPS extraction by the LptB2 FGC transporter (Wilson and Ruiz 2022). A  small molecule, IMB-0042, inhibits the interaction of LPS transporter proteins, LptA and LptC. This give rise to filament morphology, impaired OM integrity, and an accumulation of LPS in the periplasm (Dai et al. 2022). Macrocyclic peptide (MCP) antibiotics have potent antibacterial activity and represent a new class of antibiotics (Zampaloni et al. 2024), and LptB2FGC is target. Pahil et al. 2024 showed that novel antibiotics trap a substrate-bound conformation of the 
LPS transporter that stalls this machine. The inhibitors accomplish this
 by recognizing a composite binding site made up of both the Lpt 
transporter and its LPS substrate. The identity of an unusual mechanism of lipid transport inhibition reveals a druggable 
conformation of the Lpt transporter and provides the foundation for 
extending this class of antibiotics to other Gram-negative pathogens (Pahil et al. 2024).  Residues within the LptC transmembrane helix are critical for E. coli LptB(2) FG ATPase (Cina et al. 2024).

fibrils in vitro. These fibrils are β-sheet-rich, bind 
Thioflavin T (ThT), exhibit green birefringence upon staining with Congo
 Red (CR), and resist treatment with ionic detergents and proteases. Heterologously expressed RopA and RopB intracellularly aggregate in 
yeast and assemble into amyloid fibrils at the surface of E. coli. The capsules of the R. leguminosarum cells bind CR, exhibit green birefringence, and contain fibrils of RopA and RopB in vivo (Kosolapova et al. 2019).

The genes coding for these proteins are closely linked in the Brucella genome and oriented in opposite directions.

extensively generated by gene conversion between the two copies. Size reduction occurred affecting the region encoding the surface L5 loop of the
 porin, previously shown to be critical in sugar permeability, followed 
by a nucleotide reduction in the surface L8 loop-encoding region. It 
resulted in a final omp2b gene size shared between two distinct clades of non-classical Brucella spp. (African bullfrog isolates) and the group of classical Brucella species (Leclercq et al. 2019).",{'uptake'},,,,{'25367': 'molecule'},{'25367': set()},R_1_B_70_1_15,{'25367': set()}

integration involving the transition of the soluble to membrane-bound form has been presented (Lugo et al. 2016). Colicin E1 uses BtuB as receptor and possibly, the outer membrane TolC protein as the translocator (Cramer et al. 2018). Colicin E1 adopts a closed-channel state at positive transmembrane potentials, correlating with a large tilt angle of alpha-helical TMSs.

1797,1.C.3.1.1,Bacteria,Bacillota,α-Hemolysin (alpha haemolysin; Hly; Hla; α-toxin),"α-Hemolysin (alpha haemolysin; Hly; Hla; α-toxin). Fragments (13-293 aas) form heptamers like the native full length protein, but a fragment with aas 72-293 formed heptamers, octamers and nonamers. All formed Cl- permeable β-barrel channels (Vécsey-Semjén et al., 2010). The 3-d structure is available (PDB#7AHL). Both symmetry and size of cyclodextrin inhibitors and the toxin pore are important for effective inhibition (Yannakopoulou et al., 2011).  Oxoxylin A inhibits hemolysis by hindering self assembly of the hepatmeric pore in which two β-strands are contributed by each subunit (Song et al. 1996; Dong et al. 2013).  Applications of pore-forming α-haemolysin include small- and macromolecule-sensing, targeted cancer therapy, and drug delivery (Gurnev and Nestorovich 2014). Sugawara et al. 2015 studied pore formation. Structural comparisons among monomer, prepore and pore revealed a series of motions in
which the N-terminal amino latch released upon oligomerization destroys its own key hydrogen bond
betweem Asp45 and Try118. This action initiates the protrusion of the prestem. A Y118F mutant and the
N-terminal truncated mutant markedly decreased the hemolytic activity, indicating the importance
of the key hydrogen bond and the N-terminal amino latch for pore formation. A dynamic molecular mechanism of pore formation was proposed (Sugawara et al. 2015). Release of ATP from cells may occur directly through transmembrane pores formed by
α-toxin (Baaske et al. 2016). The amino latch of staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin functions in pore formation via an co-operative interaction between the N terminus and position 217 (Jayasinghe et al. 2006).
PLEKHA7 and other junctional proteins are host factors mediating death by S. aureus alpha-toxin. ADAM10 is docked to junctions by its transmembrane partner
 Tspan33, whose cytoplasmic C-terminus binds to the WW domain of PLEKHA7
 in the presence of PDZD11. ADAM10 is locked at junctions through 
binding of its cytoplasmic C terminus to afadin. Junctionally clustered 
ADAM10 supports the efficient formation of stable toxin pores. 
Disruption of the PLEKHA7-PDZD11 complex inhibits ADAM10 and toxin 
junctional clustering. This promotes toxin pore removal from the cell 
surface through an actin- and macropinocytosis-dependent process, 
resulting in cell recovery from initial injury and survival. Thus, a 
dock-and-lock molecular mechanism targets ADAM10 to junctions, providing
 a paradigm for how junctions may regulate transmembrane receptors 
through their clustering (Shah et al. 2018). Airway epithelial cells are sensitivity to S. aureus α-Toxin, but the toxin heptamers are removed by extracellular vesicle formation and lysosomal degradation (Möller et al. 2021). The effect of electroosmotic solvent flow on the binding of a neutral molecule [beta-cyclodextrin (betaCD)] to sites within alpha-hemolysin pore was investigated. Mutant α-hemolysin pores were used to which betaCD can bind from either entrance and through which the direction of water flow can be controlled by choosing the charge selectivity of the pore and the polarity of the applied potential. The Kd values for betaCD for individual mutant pores varied by >100-fold with the applied potential over a range of -120 to +120 mV (Gu et al. 2003). Alpha-hemolysin can be incorporated into bicelles (Dziubak and Sęk 2023). It exhibits long-term memory with respect to ion channel kinetics (Silva et al. 2023).",{'uptake'},,,,"{'3731': 'chloride', '2359': 'ATP', '25367': 'molecule'}","{'3731': {'cl'}, '2359': {'atp'}, '25367': set()}",R_1_C_3_1_1,"{'3731': set(), '2359': set(), '25367': set()}"

Cry46Ab mutants were constructed by targeting the putative transmembrane beta-hairpin region, showing that charged residues within the beta-hairpin control the flux of ions through channel pores and that channel-pore cation selectivity is correlated with insecticidal activity (Hayakawa et al. 2020).  Two mutants, K155E and K155I, exhibited toxicity significantly higher than that of the wild-type toxin, and the cation selectivity was also increased (Miyazaki et al. 2023).

The toxin acts on the brain, affecting vascular permeability, but also damaging neurons,  astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (Freedman et al. 2016). The pore-forming regions are initially folded up on the surfaces of the soluble precursors. To create the transmembrane pores, these regions must extend and refold into membrane-inserted beta-barrels (Tilley and Saibil 2006).

The 88 kDa secreted VacA protein, composed of an N-terminal p33 domain 
and a C-terminal p55 domain, assembles first into water-soluble oligomers before inserting into membranes.  Details for the insertion process are known (Pyburn et al. 2016).  The biology of VacAs has been reviewed (Foegeding et al. 2016). VacA preferentially associates with lipid rafts, and the affinity of VacA for rafts is independent of its capacity to oligomerize or form membrane channels (Raghunathan et al. 2018).  Cryoelectron microscopy has been used to resolve 10 structures of VacA 
assemblies, including monolayer (hexamer and heptamer) and bilayer 
(dodecamer, tridecamer, and tetradecamer) oligomers (Zhang et al. 2019).
 The models of the 88-kDa full-length VacA protomer derived from the 
near-atomic resolution maps are highly conserved among different 
oligomers and show a continuous right-handed beta-helix made up of two 
domains with extensive domain-domain interactions. The specific 
interactions between adjacent protomers in the same layer stabilizing 
the oligomers are well resolved. For double-layer oligomers, short- 
and/or long-range hydrophobic interactions between protomers across the 
two layers were found. These structures and other previous observations 
led to a mechanistic model wherein VacA hexamer correspond to the 
prepore-forming state, and the N-terminal region of VacA, responsible 
for the membrane insertion would undergo a large conformational change 
to bring the hydrophobic transmembrane region to the center of the 
oligomer for the membrane channel formation (Zhang et al. 2019).

A peptide derived from the putative transmembrane domain in the tail region of hemolysin E (aas 88-120) assembles in phospholipid membrane and exhibits lytic activity to human red blood cells (Yadav et al., 2009). Residues important for insertion and activity have been identified (Ludwig et al., 2010).  An unusual assembly pathway has been proposed (see family description; Fahie et al. 2013). The pore can be blocked by PAMAM dendrimers (Mandal et al. 2016).  The C-terminus directs pore formation and function (Sathyanarayana et al. 2016).  Similar in structure to Cry6Aa (TC# 1.C.41.2.1) although sequence similarity could not be discerned (Dementiev et al. 2016 and unpublished results).  The C-terminal domain is not directly involved in the pore structure, but is not a passive player in pore formation as it plays important roles in mediating the transition through intermediary steps leading to 
successful pore formation in a membrane (Sathyanarayana et al. 2016). Transmembrane oligomeric intermediates or ""arcs"" probably form stable proteolipidic complexes consisting of protein arcs with toroidal lipids lining the free edges (Desikan et al. 2017). High-resolution cryo-EM structures revealed that ClyA pore complexes can exist as oligomers of a tridecamer and a tetradecamer, at estimated resolutions of 3.2 Å and 4.3 Å, respectively. The 2.8 A cryo-EM structure of a dodecamer dramatically improves the existing structural model. Structural analysis indicates that protomers from distinct oligomers resemble each other, and neighboring protomers adopt a conserved interaction mode. A stabilized intermediate state of ClyA during the transition process from soluble monomers to pore complexes was identified. Even without the formation of mature pore complexes, ClyA can permeabilize membranes and allow leakage of particles less than ~400 Daltons. In addition, ClyA forms pore complexes in the presence of cholesterol within artificial liposomes (Peng et al. 2019). The mechanism of pore formation has been reviewed (Sathyanarayana et al. 2020). Maurya et al. 2022 described how to monitor the nanopore assembly of bacterial pore-forming toxin Cytolysin A (ClyA) on crowded lipid membranes with single-molecule photobleaching analysis.

Sublytic concentrations of LktA cause inflammatory responses of ovine leukocytes while higher concentrations result in formation of transmembrane channels in target cells that may cause cell lysis and apoptosis. Channel formation by LktA occurs in artificial lipid bilayer membranes made of different lipids. LktA channels had a single-channel conductance of about 60 pS in 0.1 M KCl, which is about one tenth of the conductance of most RTX-toxins with the exception of the adenylate cyclase toxin of Bordetella pertussis (Benz et al. 2019).

Although homologous, HlyA (1.C.11.1.3) and CyaA  exhibit different modes of permeabilization (Fiser and Konopásek 2009).  A pore model comprising three alpha2-loop-alpha3 hairpins suggested that
Gly530XXGly533XXXGly537  in TMS2 could function in toxin oligomerization (Juntapremjit et al. 2015).  Structural integrity of TMSs 1,
2, 3 and 5, but not 4, is important for haemolytic activity, particularly for transmembrane helices 2 and 3 that might form the pore (Powthongchin and Angsuthanasombat 2009). CyaA forms small cation-selective membrane pores that permeabilize cells for potassium
efflux, contributing to cytotoxicity of CyaA and eventually provoking colloid-osmotic cell lysis (Wald et al. 2016).  The toxin penetrates myeloid phagocytes expressing the complement receptor 3 and 
delivers into the cytosol its N-terminal adenylate cyclase enzyme 
domain (~400 residues). In parallel, the ~1300 residue-long RTX hemolysin 
moiety of CyaA permeabilizes target 
cell membranes for efflux of cytosolic potassium ions (Svedova et al. 2016).  Positively-charged side-chains substituted at positions Gln574 and Glu581 in the pore-lining alpha3 enhance hemolytic activity and ion-channel opening, mimicing the highly-active RTX (repeat-in-toxin) cytolysins (Kurehong et al. 2017). Residues 529 to 549 participate in membrane penetration and pore-forming activity (Roderova et al. 2019). Two distinct conformers of CyaA appear to 
accomplish its two parallel activities within target cell membranes. The 
translocating conformer would deliver the N-terminal adenylyl cyclase domain into the cytosol of cells, while 
the pore precursor conformer would assemble into oligomeric 
cation-selective pores and permeabilize cellular membrane. Both toxin 
activities involve a membrane-interacting 'AC-to-Hly-linking 
segment' (residues 400 to 500). Two clusters of negatively charged residues within this linking segment (Glu419 to Glu432 and Asp445 to Glu448) 
regulate the balance between the AC domain translocating and 
pore-forming capacities of CyaA as a function of the calcium concentration (Sukova et al. 2020). Four cholesterol-recognition motifs in the pore-forming and translocation domains of CyaA are essential for invasion of eukaryotic cells and lysis of erythrocytes (Amuategi et al. 2022).",{'uptake'},,,,{'25367': 'molecule'},{'25367': set()},R_1_C_11_1_4,{'25367': set()}

In the formation of the pore forming toxin, the elongated toxin monomer binds stably to the membrane in an ""end-on"" orientation, with its long axis approximately perpendicular to the plane of the membrane bilayer (Ramachandran et al. 2005). This orientation is largely retained, even after monomers associate to form an oligomeric prepore complex. The domain 3 (D3) polypeptide segments that ultimately form transmembrane beta-hairpins remain far above the membrane surface in both the membrane-bound monomer and prepore oligomer. Upon pore formation, these segments enter the bilayer, whereas D1 moves to a position that is substantially closer to the membrane. Therefore, the extended D2 beta-structure that connects D1 to membrane-bound D4 appears to bend or otherwise reconfigure during the prepore-to-pore transition of the perfringolysin O oligomer (Ramachandran et al. 2005). The prepore to pore transition has been visualized by electron microscopy (Dang et al. 2005). Phosphatidylcholine in the outer
leaflet increases the cholesterol concentration required to induce PFO binding while
phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine in the inner leaflet of asymmetric vesicles
stabilized the formation of a deeply inserted conformation that does not form pores, even
though it contains transmembrane segments (Lin and London 2014). This conformation may represent an important intermediate
stage in PFO pore formation.  Cholesterol recognition, oligomerization, and the conformational changes involved in pore formation have been reviewed (Johnson and Heuck 2014), and the involvement of the D1 domain in structural transitions leading to pore formation has been studied (Kacprzyk-Stokowiec et al. 2014).  Interaction of PFO with
cholesterol is sufficient to initiate an irreversible sequence of coupled conformational
changes that extend throughout the toxin molecule and induce pore formation (Heuck et al. 2007).  Once this transmembrane beta-barrel protein is inserted, PFO assembles into pore-forming oligomers containing 30-50
PFO monomers. These form a pore of up to 300 Å, far exceeding the size of most other proteinaceous
pores.  Decreasing the length of the β-strands causes the pore to shrink (Lin et al. 2015). Site-directed mutagenesis data combined with binding studies performed with different sterols, and molecular modeling are beginning to shed light on the interaction with cholesterol (Savinov and Heuck 2017). Fine-tuning of the stability of beta-strands by Y181 in perfringolysin O directs the prepore to pore transition (Kulma et al. 2019).",{'uptake'},,,,{'25367': 'molecule'},{'25367': set()},R_1_C_12_1_1,{'25367': set()}

It exhibits a broad range of conductances (El-Rachkidy et al., 2008) and localizes to the cell wall of S. pneumoniae (Price and Camilli, 2009). Binding of ILY to human CD59 initiates a series of conformational changes within the toxin that result in the conversion of the soluble monomer into an oligomeric membrane-embedded pore complex. The assembly intermediates increase the sensitivity of the host cell to lysis by its complement membrane attack complex, apparently by blocking the hCD59-binding site for complement proteins C8α and C9 (LaChapelle et al., 2009).  The herbal bioflavonoid, Apigenin, inhibits oligomerization of PLY and protects against pneumonia (Song et al. 2016).  Pneumolysin alters lysosomal integrity in epithelial cells, 
but not in macrophages, inducing lysosomal membrane permeabilization 
and release of lysosomal content (Malet et al. 2016). A four-step mechanism of membrane attachment and pore formation has been proosed (van Pee et al. 2016).  Pneumolysin is both necessary and 
sufficient to promote inflammation, increasing shedding and causing transmission to others (Zafar et al. 2017). The release of pneumococcal autolysin, which promotes cell lysis and the 
release of pneumolysin, is inhibited by treatment with azithromycin and
 erythromycin, but recombinant autolysin restores 
the release of pneumolysin (Domon et al. 2018). Pneumolyin exhibits direct cardiotoxic and immunosuppressive activities, as well as indirect pro-inflammatory/pro-thrombotic activities (Anderson et al. 2018). The transmembrane beta-hairpins of the PLY pore are stable only for oligomers, forming a curtain-like membrane-spanning beta-sheet, and its hydrophilic inner face draws water into the protein-lipid interface, forcing lipids to recede (Vögele et al. 2019). Formation of pre-pore complexes of pneumolysin is accompanied by a decrease in short-range order of lipid molecules throughout vesicle bilayers (Faraj et al. 2020). Although pneumolysin-induced inflammation drives person-to-person transmission from the nasopharynx, the primary reservoir for pneumococcus, it also contributes to high mortality rates, creating a bottleneck that hampers widespread bacterial dissemination, thus acting as a double-edged sword (Badgujar et al. 2020). Serotype 1 ST306, a widespread pneumococcal clone, harbours a non-hemolytic variant of pneumolysin (Ply-NH). Crystal structural analyses of Ply-NH led to the identification of Y150H and T172I as key substitutions responsible for loss of its pore-forming activity. A novel inter-molecular cation-pi interaction governs formation of the transmembrane beta-hairpins (TMH) in the pore state of Ply, which can be applied to other CDCs. H150 in Ply-NH disrupts this interaction, while I172 provides structural rigidity to domain-3 through hydrophobic interactions, inhibiting TMH formation. Loss of pore-forming activity enables improved cellular invasion and autophagy evasion, promoting an atypical intracellular lifestyle for pneumococcus, a finding that was corroborated in in vivo infection models. Attenuation of inflammatory responses and tissue damage promoted tolerance of Ply-NH-expressing pneumococcus in the lower respiratory tract. Adoption of this altered lifestyle may be necessary for ST306 due to its limited nasopharyngeal carriage with Ply-NH, aided partly by loss of its pore forming ability, facilitating a benign association of SPN in an alternative, intracellular host niche (Badgujar et al. 2020). Apigenin protects mice from pneumococcal pneumonia by inhibiting the cytolytic activity of pneumolysin (Song et al. 2016). PLY can disrupt plasma membrane integrity, deregulating cellular homeostasis. At lytic concentrations, PLY causes cell death, but at sub-lytic concentrations, PLY triggers host cell survival pathways that cooperate to reseal the damaged plasma membrane and restore cell homeostasis (Pereira et al. 2022). While PLY is generally considered a pivotal factor promoting S. pneumoniae colonization and survival, it is also a powerful trigger of the innate and adaptive host immune response against bacterial infection. The dichotomy of PLY as both a key bacterial virulence factor and a trigger for host immune modulation allows the toxin to display both ""Yin"" and ""Yang"" properties during infection, promoting disease by membrane perforation and activating inflammatory pathways, while also mitigating damage by triggering host cell repair and initiating anti-inflammatory responses. Due to its cytolytic activity and diverse immunomodulatory properties, PLY is integral to every stage of S. pneumoniae pathogenesis and may tip the balance towards either the pathogen or the host depending on the context of infection (Pereira et al. 2022).",{'uptake'},,,,{},{},R_1_C_12_1_5,{}

CFTR transiently increases phagosomal chloride concentrations after infection, potentiating pore formation and vacuole lysis. Thus, Listeria exploits mechanisms of cellular ion homeostasis to escape the phagosome (Radtke et al., 2011).  LLO is an example of a large beta-barrel pore that exhibits plasticity, controlled by environmental cues like pH (Podobnik et al. 2015).  Pore formation is a multistep process involving the sequential formation of arcs, slits, small rings and larger rings before formation of transmembrane pores (Mulvihill et al. 2015).  LLO promotes nanoscale membrane reorganization (Sarangi et al. 2016). It alters lysosomal integrity in epithelial cells, 
but not in macrophages, inducing lysosomal membrane permeabilization 
and release of lysosomal content (Malet et al. 2016). LLO pore activity is active at acidic pH (<6), but not at neutral pH because pore-formation is controlled by rapid, irreversible denaturation of its structure at neutral pH at temperatures >30 degrees C. Denaturation is triggered at neutral pH by the premature unfolding of the domain 3 transmembrane beta-hairpins, structures that normally form the transmembrane beta-barrel. A triad of acidic residues within domain 3 functions as the pH sensor (Schuerch et al. 2005). Kisovec et al. 2017 have made a mutant variant with hemolytic activity that is pH-dependent. LLO does not form pores of regular shape or size, but rather forms membrane inserted arcs that propagate and damage lipid membranes as lineactants (Jiao et al. 2021). At low PFT concentrations, a regime of increased lipid diffusivity is attributed to lipid ejection events because of a preponderance of ring-like pore states (Ilangumaran Ponmalar et al. 2021). At higher protein concentrations in which membrane-inserted arc-like pores dominate, lipid ejection is less efficient and the ensuing crowding results in a lowering of lipid diffusion.",{'uptake'},,,,{'25367': 'molecule'},{'25367': set()},R_1_C_12_1_7,{'25367': set()}

A cryo-electron microscopic study revealed low resolution structures for different functional forms (Dutta et al., 2009). Crystal structures of the soluble and transmembrane heptamer reveal common features among disparate pore-forming toxins (De and Olson, 2011). The toxin forms transmembrane heptameric β-barrel channels with two lectin activities on the β-prism and the β-trefoil (Rai et al. 2013).  A ring of tryptophan residues forms the narrowest constriction in the transmembrane channel reminiscent of the phenylalanine clamp identified in anthrax protective antigen (Krantz et al., 2005).  A single point mutation prevents membrane integration and pore formation (Paul and Chattopadhyay 2012).  The
deletion of the pre-stem segment does not affect membrane binding and pre-pore oligomer formation, but it critically abrogates the functional pore-forming activity of VCC (Paul and Chattopadhyay 2013).  The membrane-bound monomer can not form pores (Rai and Chattopadhyay 2014).  VCC can be delivered to host cells via extracellular bacterial vesicles (Elluri et al. 2014).  Loops within the membrane-proximal region of VCC play critical roles in
determining the functional interactions of the toxin with the membrane lipids that allow pore formation (Rai and Chattopadhyay 2015).  VCC may interfer with signalling in the target cell as well as form pores (Khilwani and Chattopadhyay 2015).  A functional map of the VCC membrane-binding surface has been published (De et al. 2015).  Residues involved in oligomerization have been identified (Rai and Chattopadhyay 2016). The multiple membrane interaction mechanisms of VCC have been reviewed (Kathuria and Chattopadhyay 2018). A model of the transmembrane pore has been presented that accounts for some of its properties (Pantano and Montecucco 2006).  An overview of the understanding regarding the membrane 
interaction mechanisms of VCC and their functional implications for the
 pore-forming activity of the toxin have been reviewed (Kathuria and Chattopadhyay 2018). The specific cholesterol-binding ability of VCC does not appear to 
dictate its association with the cholesterol-rich micro-domains on human
 erythrocytes but may be essential for formation of the membrane integraed pore structure (Gupta et al. 2022). Rather, targeting of VCC toward the membrane 
micro-domains of human erythrocytes possibly acts to facilitate the 
cholesterol-dependent pore-formation mechanism of the toxin (Cyr 2018). Tyrosine in the hinge region of the pore-forming motif regulates oligomeric beta-barrel pore formation (Mondal et al. 2020). Single-particle cryo-EM was used to characterize the structure of the VCC oligomer in large unilamellar vesicles. The rim domain amino acid residues of VCC interacting with lipid membrane were visualized. Cryo-EM views of lipid bilayer-embedded VCC suggested interesting conformational variabilities, especially in the transmembrane channel, which could have a potential impact on the pore architecture and assist in understanding the pore formation mechanism (Sengupta et al. 2021). The Glu289 residue in the pore-forming motif of VCC is important for efficient beta-barrel pore formation (Mondal et al. 2022).",{'uptake'},,,,{'24870': 'ion'},{'24870': set()},R_1_C_14_1_1,{'24870': set()}

The protein-lipid interactions at low pH induce oligomerization of the MakA cytotoxin (Nadeem et al. 2022). The alpha-pore-forming toxins (α-PFTs) from pathogenic bacteria damage host cell membranes by pore formation. Nadeem et al. 2022 demonstrated the mechanism of MakA/B/E tripartite toxin, MakA is involved in membrane pore formation similar to other α-PFTs. In contrast, MakA in isolation forms tube-like structures in acidic endosomal compartments of epithelial cells in vitro. Nadeem et al. 2022 unraveled the dynamics of tubular growth, which occurs in a pH-, lipid-, and concentration-dependent manner. Within acidified organelle lumens or when incubated with cells in acidic media, MakA forms oligomers and remodels membranes into high-curvature tubes leading to loss of membrane integrity. A 3.7 Å cryo-EM structure of MakA filaments (7P3RA-D) revealed a unique protein-lipid superstructure. MakA forms a pinecone-like spiral with a central cavity and a thin annular lipid bilayer embedded between the MakA transmembrane helices in its active alpha-PFT conformation.

X-ray structures are available (Bräuning et al. 2018). While a yaxAB mutant (ΔyaxAB)
 is capable of colonizing mice at the same level as the wild type, the mutation slightly delays the course of infection and results in differing 
pathology in the spleen.  Wagner et al. 2013 found that yaxAB encode a cytotoxin capable of lysing mammalian cells, that 
both YaxA and YaxB are required for cytotoxic activity, and that the two
 proteins associate. YaxAB-mediated
 cell death occurs via osmotic lysis through the formation of distinct 
membrane pores. In silico tertiary structural analysis identified 
predicted structural homology between YaxA and proteins in pore-forming 
toxin complexes from Bacillus cereus (HBL-B) and Escherichia coli (HlyE). Thus, it appears that YaxAB function as virulence factors by inducing cell lysis through the formation of pores in the host cell membrane (Wagner et al. 2013). YaxAB represents a family of binary α-PFTs with orthologues in human, insect, and plant pathogens. Bräuning et al. 2018 presented crystal structures of YaxA and YaxB, together 
with a cryo-electron microscopy map of the YaxAB complex. Their structures revealed a pore predominantly composed of 
decamers of YaxA-YaxB heterodimers. Both subunits bear membrane-active 
moieties, but only YaxA is capable of binding to membranes by itself. 
YaxB can subsequently be recruited to membrane-associated YaxA and 
induced to present its lytic transmembrane helices. Pore formation can 
progress by further oligomerization of YaxA-YaxB dimers (Bräuning et al. 2018). The 3D structure is known (PDB# 6GY6; Gupta et al. 2023).",{'uptake'},,,,{'25367': 'molecule'},{'25367': set()},R_1_C_41_2_7,{'25367': set()}

insects by strongly depressing the immune system and colonizing the 
entire body. The peptide cytotoxin, XaxAB, has been purified from X. nematophila broth, and the cytolytic effect on insect immunocytes and 
the hemolytic effect on mammalian red blood cells have been 
described (Vigneux et al. 2007). This toxin, Xenorhabdus alpha-xenorhabdolysin (Xax), triggers apoptosis in both insect and 
mammalian cells. Vigneux et al. 2007 also cloned and sequenced xaxAB, and showed that hemolytic activity was observed only if 
the two proteins were added in the appropriate order. The membrane inserted complex forms a 1-1.3 MDa large pore complexes to perforate the host cell membrane. Schubert et al. 2018 reported the cryo-EM structure of the XaxAB pore complex and the crystal structures of the soluble monomers of XaxA and XaxB. The structures reveal that XaxA and XaxB are built similarly and appear as heterodimers in the 12-15 subunit containing pore, classifying XaxAB as bi-component α-PFT. Major conformational changes in XaxB, including the swinging out of an amphipathic helix, are responsible for membrane insertion. XaxA acts as an activator and stabilizer for XaxB that forms the actual transmembrane pore. A novel structural model for the mechanism of Xax intoxication was proposed (Schubert et al. 2018).

Both symmetry and size of cyclodextrin inhibitors and the toxin pore are important for effective inhibition (Yannakopoulou et al., 2011).  A cryo electron microscopic structure of the anthrax protective antigen translocon and the N-terminal domain of anthrax lethal factor (aLF) inserted into a nanodisc model lipid bilayer has been solved revealing a cap, a narrow stalk and a transmembrane channel (Gogol et al. 2013).

The 3-d structure of PA, showing the channel and the φ-clamp, and providing information about the multi-step mechanism by which low pH is sensed and the membrane-spanning channel is formed has been published (Jiang et al. 2015).  The export of the lethal factor and edema factor from the endosome into the host cytosol is dependent on the proton motive force (pmf) (Krantz et al. 2006; Colby and Krantz 2015). Translocation of anthrax toxin's lethal factor is initiated by entry of its N terminus into the protective antigen channel (Zhang et al. 2004). The endopeptidase activity of anthrax lethal factor (aLF) prevents the destruction of B.anthracis spores intracellularly by host macrophages, meanwhile disabling the signaling pathways extracellularly that leads to host lethality. This activity has been used for nanopore detection (Li et al. 2022).",{'uptake'},,,,{'25367': 'molecule'},{'25367': set()},R_1_C_42_1_1,{'25367': set()}

It can be used as an oncoleaking/tumor eradication agent as this pore-forming protein exerts specific and rapid toxicity towards claudin-3- and -4-overexpressing cancers (Pahle et al. 2015). The crystal structure of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin displays features of beta-pore-forming toxins (Kitadokoro et al., 2011). The N-terminal region (nCPE) mediates the cytotoxic effect through pore formation in the plasma membrane of the mammalian host cell. The C-terminal region (cCPE) binds to the second extracellular loop of a subset of claudins, Claudin-3 and claudin-4, with high affinity (Veshnyakova et al., 2010). cCPE is not cytotoxic but is a potent modulator of tight junctions. The toxin forms highly cation-selective channels in lipid bilayers (Benz and Popoff 2018).

The soluble monomer is cleaved to yield oligomeric pores.  The structure of a cleaved form lacking the transmembrane domain has been solved by x-ray crystalography and cryo-EM (PDB#4MJT; Leone et al. 2015).  The structure displays an elongated shape, resembling those of beta-pore-forming toxins such as
aerolysin, but it lacks the receptor binding domain. Pro-monalysin forms a stable doughnut-like 18-mer complex
composed of two disk-shaped nonamers held together by N-terminal swapping of the pro-peptides. This is in contrast with the monomeric pro-form of the other beta-PFTs that are receptor-dependent for membrane interaction. The membrane-spanning region of pro-monalysin is fully buried in
the center of the doughnut, suggesting that upon pro-peptide cleavage, the two disk-shaped nonamers
can - and have to - dissociate to leave the transmembrane segments free to deploy and lead to pore
formation. In contrast with other toxins, the delivery of 18 subunits at once, nearby the cell
surface, may be used to by-pass the requirement for a receptor-dependent concentration to reach the
threshold for oligomerization into the pore-forming complex (Leone et al. 2015).",{'uptake'},,,,{'25367': 'molecule'},{'25367': set()},R_1_C_59_3_1,{'25367': set()}

 act by forming transmembrane ion channels, since the peptide rapidly 
depolarizes the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, simultaneously 
decreasing the membrane potential and intracellular potassium contents. The name 'proteusin' was inspired by Proteus, a Greek shape-shifting sea god. Compared
 to polytheonamide B, polytheonamide A has an additional sulfoxide 
moiety at Met-141, which arises from spontaneous oxidation during 
polytheonamide isolation. The potent cytotoxicity of PolyA against MCF-7 cancer cells originates from its two ion transport functions.

2523,1.E.19.3.1,Bacteria,Bacillota,The C,"The C. difficile holin, TcdE.  TcdE acts as a holin-like protein to facilitate the release of C. 
difficile toxins A and B to the extracellular environment, but, unlike most phage
 holins, it does not cause the non-specific release of cytosolic contents. 
TcdE is thus a bacterial holin that 
releases toxins into the environment by a phage-like system (Tan et al. 2001; Govind and Dupuy 2012).  Different isoforms have differing activities in toxin release (Govind et al. 2015). An autolysin, Cwp19 (L7PGA3), may also play a role in toxin release (El Meouche and Peltier 2018). Adaptation of this phage-derived holin/endolysin system to toxin transport has been discussed (Mehner-Breitfeld et al. 2018). Thus, TcdE exists as three isoforms, differing with respect to their N-terminal extensions.  The longest TcdE isoform has a moderate effect on cell growth, whereas 
the shortest isoform strongly induces lysis. The effect of the longest 
isoform was inhibitory for cell lysis, implying a regulatory function of
 the N-terminal 24 residues.  Mehner-Breitfeld et al. 2018 analyzed the PaLoc sequence of 44 C. difficile isolates and found that four of these encode only the short TcdE isoform, and the most closely related holins from C. difficile phages only possess one of these initiation codons, indicating that the N-terminal extensions of TcdE evolved in C. difficile.",{'uptake'},,,,{'27026': 'toxin'},{'27026': set()},R_1_E_19_3_1,{'27026': set()}

permit the passage of endolysins across the cytoplasmic membrane of 
prokaryotes, ultimately resulting in cell wall degradation and cell 
lysis. However, there are  examples known for non-lytic 
holin-dependent secretion of proteins by bacteria, indicating that 
holins may transport proteins without causing large membrane 
lesions. Phage-derived holins can be used for a non-lytic endolysin 
translocation to permeabilize the cell wall for the passage of secreted 
proteins. In addition, clostridia, which do not possess the Tat pathway 
for transport of folded proteins, most likely employ non-lytic 
holin-mediated transport also for secretion of toxins and bacteriocins 
that are incompatible with the general Sec pathway. The small holin TpeE mediates non-lytic toxin secretion in Clostridium perfringens. TpeE contains only one short transmembrane 
helix that is followed by an amphipathic helix, which is reminiscent of 
TatA, the membrane-permeabilizing component of the Tat translocon for 
folded proteins. Brüser and Mehner-Breitfeld 2022 reviewed the known cases of non-lytic 
holin-mediated transport and then focus on the structural and functional
 comparison of TatA and TpeE, resulting in a mechanistic model for 
holin-mediated transport. This model is strongly supported by a so far 
not recognized naturally occurring holin-endolysin fusion protein.",{'uptake'},,,,{'14911': 'protein'},{'14911': set()},R_1_E_27_1_8,{'14911': set()}

Can function as a Na+  (K+)/H+  antiporter (Lewinson and Bibi 2001; Higgins, 2007). Is known to provide resistance to a wide variety of dissimilar toxic compounds, including neutral, cationic and zwitterionic substances.  Crystals that diffracted to 3.4 Å resolution and belonged to the hexagonal space group P6122 have been obtained (Nagarathinam et al. 2017). For review of MdfA see Lewinson et al., 2006. The conformational switch accompanying transport is induced by the promiscuous binding of substrates and/or inhibitors to the binding pocket (Fluman et al., 2009). MdfA normally extrudes monovalent cationic drugs in exchange for a single proton, but it transports divalent cationic drugs poorly. It can be mutated to antiport a divalent cationic drug for 2 protons (Tirosh et al., 2012). Transporters acting across the inner and outer membranes have synergistic effects with each other, but transporters acting across the same membrane are usually additive but can be synergistic under special circumstances, owing to a bifurcation controlled by the barrier constant (Saha et al. 2020). Promiscuity in the geometry of electrostatic interactions between  MdfA and cationic substrates has been demonstrated (Adler and Bibi 2005). With respect to ethidium bromide, the inner membrane transporter MdfA is synergistic to the TolC-dependent efflux across the outer membrane (Saha et al. 2020). The conformational behavior of MdfA in response to substrate binding has been studied (Bahrenberg et al. 2021).

lactose, melibiose, thio-β-methyl galactopyranoside (TMG), isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside (IPTG), 4-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside, 4-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside and galactopyranosyl-1-glycerol. Single point mutations allow transport of sucrose and maltose (King and Wilson 1990).  Crystal structures and modeling reveal the
cytoplasmic open state and the periplasmic open state (PDB ID: 1PV7). A structure with a bound lactose homolog, beta-D-galactopyranosyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside, revealed the sugar-binding site in a cavity, and residues that play major roles in substrate recognition and proton translocation were identified (Abramson et al., 2003; Pendse et al., 2010). The
membrane lipid composition determines the topology of LacY (Dowhan and
Bogdanov, 2011). Smirnova et al. (2011) have
provided evidence that the opening of the periplasmic cavity in LacY is the
limiting step for sugar binding. Evidence for an alternating sites mechanism of
transport has been summarized (Smirnova et al., 2011). Eames
and Kortemme (2012) have shown that when
considering expression of the lac operon, LacY function (H+ co-transport)
and not protein production is the primary origin of cost fitness. Homology
threading of several MFS porters based on the LacY 3-d structure has been
reported (Kasho et al., 2006). The
alternating-access mechanism has been suggested to arise from inverted
topological repeats (Radestock and Forrest, 2011; Madej et al. 2012), but
this proposal has been contested (Västermark and Saier 2014; Västermark et al. 2014).
Mechanistic features of LacY have been summarized (Kaback 2015). Insertion into the membrane depends on YidC (TC# 2.A.9.3.1) and may occur in a stepwise, stochastic manner employing multiple coexisting pathways to complete the folding process (Serdiuk et al. 2017). The glucose Enzyme IIA (Crr) protein binds LacY to allosterically inhibit its activity, promoting inducer exclusion (Hoischen et al. 1996; Hariharan et al. 2015). Protonated LacY binds D-galactopyranosides specifically, inducing an 
occluded state that can open to either side of the membrane (Kumar et al. 2014). LacY can form amyloid-like fibrils under destabilizing conditions (Stroobants et al. 2017). Multiple conformations of LacY have been solved (Kumar et al. 2018).  Direct interactions between LacY and its lipid environment uniquely contribute to its membrane protein organization and function (Vitrac et al. 2020). The lactose permease purified from E. coli exhibiting varied phospholipid compositions has the same topology and function as in its membrane of origin (Vitrac et al. 2019).",{'uptake'},sym,['h'],<=>,"{'17306': 'maltose', '28053': 'melibiose', '17716': 'lactose', '17992': 'sucrose', '546840': '4-nitrophenyl alpha-D-galactoside', '355715': '4-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactoside', '17540': 'methyl beta-D-galactoside'}","{'17306': {'malt'}, '28053': {'6dg'}, '17716': {'lcts'}, '17992': {'sucr'}, '546840': set(), '355715': set(), '17540': set()}",R_2_A_1_5_1,"{'17306': {'malt_e + h_e <=> malt_c + h_c'}, '28053': {'6dg_e + h_e <=> 6dg_c + h_c'}, '17716': {'lcts_e + h_e <=> lcts_c + h_c'}, '17992': {'sucr_e + h_e <=> sucr_c + h_c'}, '546840': set(), '355715': set(), '17540': set()}"

Transmembrane helix I and periplasmic loop 1 are involved in osmosensing and osmoprotectant transport (Keates et al., 2010).  ProP detects the increase in cytoplasmic cation concentration associated with osmotically induced cell dehydration and mediates osmolyte uptake into bacteria (Ozturk et al. 2020). ProP is a 12-TMS protein with an α-helical, cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (CTD) linked to TMS XII. The CTD helix associates with the anionic membrane surface to lock ProP in an inactive conformation. The release of the CTD may activate ProP. Molecular dynamics simulations showed specific intrapeptide salt bridges forming when the CTD associated with the membrane. The salt bridge Lys447-Asp455 weakened CTD-lipid interactions at 0.25 M KCl, and gradual stiffening of the membrane with increasing salinity was obseerved. Thus, salt cations may affect CTD release and activate ProP by increasing the order of membrane phospholipids (Ozturk et al. 2020).

interface can exclude diacylphospholipids from the LplT binding site. A dual substrate-accessing mechanism, in which LplT recruits LPLs to its substrate-binding site via two routes, either from its extracellular entry site, or through a membrane-embedded groove between transmembrane helices, and it then moves them towards the inner membrane leaflet (Lin et al. 2018).",{'uptake'},uni,[],<=>,"{'55493': '1-O-acylglycerophosphoethanolamine', '60430': '2-monolysocardiolipin'}","{'55493': set(), '60430': set()}",R_2_A_1_42_1,"{'55493': set(), '60430': set()}"

3542,2.A.2.1.1,Bacteria,Pseudomonadota,Melibiose permease,"Melibiose permease. Catalyzes the coupled stoichiometric symport of a galactoside with a 
cation (either Na+, Li+, or H+). Based on LacY, a 3-d model has been derived (Yousef and Guan, 2009). Asp55 and Asp59 are essential for Na+ binding. Asp124 may play a critical role by allowing Na+-induced conformational changes and sugar binding. Asp19 may facilitate melibiose binding (Granell et al., 2010).  The alternate access mechanism fits better into a flexible gating mechanism rather than the archetypical helical rigid-
body rocker-switch mechanism (Wang et al. 2016).  Crystal structures of Salmonella typhimurium MelB in two 
conformations, representing an outward partially occluded and an outward
 inactive state (Ethayathulla et al. 2014). MelB adopts a typical MFS fold and contains a
 previously unidentified cation-binding motif. Three conserved acidic 
residues form a pyramidal-shaped cation-binding site for Na+, Li+ or
 H+, which is in close proximity to the sugar-binding site. Both 
cosubstrate-binding sites are mainly contributed by the residues from 
the amino-terminal domain (Ethayathulla et al. 2014). The Glucose Enzyme IIA protein of the PTS binds MelB either in the absence or presence of a galactoside, and binding decreases the affinity for melibiose, giving rise to inducer exclusion (Saier 1989; Hariharan and Guan 2014).",{'uptake'},sym,['h'],-->,"{'30143': 'lithium(1+)', '9175': 'sodium(1+)', '24636': 'proton', '6733': 'melibiose'}","{'30143': set(), '9175': {'na1'}, '24636': {'h'}, '6733': {'6dg'}}",R_2_A_2_1_1,"{'30143': set(), '9175': set(), '24636': set(), '6733': {'6dg_e + h_e --> 6dg_c + h_c'}}"

to facilitate the conversion of zinc-binding energy to the kinetic power stroke of a vectorial zinc
transport (Gupta et al. 2014). Of the two cavities of the dimer, only one was accessible from the cytosol during transport. Zinc(II) binding to D49 of the transport site triggered a rearrangement of the TMS that closed the accessible cavity.

 binding to the cytoplasmic fragment creates a docking site to which a 
metallochaperone can bind for delivery and transport of zinc. A proposal was advanced that it functions as a

Point mutations change the specificity and kinetics of metal uptake (Taudte and Grass, 2010). Important for virulence in Salmonella (Karlinsey et al., 2010). ZupT has an asymmetric binuclear metal center in the transmembrane domain; one metal-binding site, M1, binds zinc, cadmium, and iron, while the other, M2, binds iron only and with higher affinity than M1. Using site-specific mutagenesis and transport activity measurements in whole cells and proteoliposomes, Roberts et al. 2021 showed that zinc is transported from M1, while iron is transported from M2. The two sites share a common bridging ligand, a conserved glutamate residue. M1 and M2 have ligands from highly conserved motifs in transmembrane domains 4 and 5. Additionally, M2 has a ligand from transmembrane domain 6, a glutamate residue, which is conserved in the gufA subfamily of ZIP transporters, including ZupT and the human ZIP11. Unlike cadmium, iron transport from M2 does not inhibit the zinc transport activity but slightly stimulates it. This stimulated activity is mediated through the bridging carboxylate ligand. The binuclear zinc-iron binding center in ZupT has likely evolved to enable the transport of essential metals from two different sites without competition; a similar mechanism of metal transport is likely to be found in the gufA subfamily of ZIP transporter proteins (Roberts et al. 2021).",{'uptake'},,,,{},{},R_2_A_5_5_1,{}

Bagai et al. (2007) reported that CusB (MFP) binds one molecule of Ag+  or Cu+  via four conserved methionines and induces a substrate-linked conformational change (Bagai et al., 2007). The crystal structures of CusB are available (Su et al., 2009). The crystal structure of the CusAB complex has been solved (PDB# 3K07) (Su et al., 2011a). CusC is listed under TC# 1.B.17.3.5. The metal-binding methionines play a role in restricting the substrates to monovalent heavy metals (Conroy et al., 2010). It has been reported to export L-cysteine (Yamada et al., 2006). Crystal structures of the CusA efflux pump suggested that methionine residues in a 3-methionine cluster, bind the metal as a transport intermediate (Long et al., 2010). Four methionine pairs in the transmembrane region, and one in the periplasmic domain may comprise the channel. Cu+  is exported from the cytoplasm to the periplasmic chaparone, CusF in the extracellular space (Padilla-Benavides et al. 2014). The Cus efflux system removes Cu+ and Ag+ from both the cell cytoplasm and the periplasm (Su et al., 2011b; Delmar et al. 2014). Metal-bound CusB is required for activation of Cu+ transfer from
 CusF directly to a site in the CusA antiporter (Chacón et al. 2014). Metal transfer occurs between 
CusF and apo-CusB, and when metal-loaded, CusB plays a role in the
 regulation of metal ion transfer from CusF to CusA in the periplasm.  The ratio of CusA (RND):CusB (MFP):CusC (OMF) is 3:6:3 (Delmar et al. 2013).

Lateral entry of substrates from the lipid bilayer into AcrB and its homologues has been proposed (Yu et al., 2003a; 2003b). [An asymmetric trimeric structure is established with AcrA having a hexameric structure, and TolC having a trimeric structure (Seeger et al., 2006]. A structure of a complex with YajC is also known (Törnroth-Horsefield et al., 2007). A covalently linked trimer of AcrB provides evidence for a peristaltic pump, alternative access, rotation mechanism (Takatsuka and Nikaido, 2009;Nikaido and Takatsuka, 2009; Pos, 2009) Further evidence for a rotatory mechanisms stems from kinetic analyses for cephalosporin efflux which can exhibit positive cooperativity (Nagano and Nikaido, 2009). May also export signaling molecules for cell-cell communication (Yang et al., 2006). The substrates may be captured in the lower cleft region of AcrB, then transported through the binding pocket, the gate, and finally to the AcrA funnel that connects AcrB to TolC (Husain & Nikaido et al., 2010).  AcrB has been converted into a light-driven proton pump using delta-rhodopsin (dR) linked to AcrB via a glycophorin A transmembrane domain. This created a
solar powered protein capable of selectively capturing antibiotics from bulk solutions (Kapoor and Wendell 2013).  The trimeric structure is essential for activity (Ye et al. 2014).  Association with AcrZ (TC# 8.A.50), a small 1 TMS protein (49 aas) that modifies the substrate specificity of AcrAB, has been demonstrated (Hobbs et al. 2012).  In a similar way, the binding of YajC to AcrB stimulates the export of ampicillin (Törnroth-Horsefield et al. 2007). AcrZ binds to
AcrB in a concave surface of the transmembrane domain (Du et al. 2015).  Substrate binding accelerates conformational transitions and substrate dissociation, demonstrating cooperativity (Wang et al. 2015). The overall structure of AcrAB-TolC exemplifies
the adaptor bridging model, wherein the funnel-like AcrA hexamer forms an intermeshing cogwheel
interaction with the alpha-barrel tip region of TolC. Direct interaction between AcrB and TolC
is not allowed (Kim et al. 2015).  TMS2 in AcrB is required for lipophilic carboxylate binding. A groove shaped by the interface between TMS1 and TMS2 specifically binds fusidic acid and other lipophilic
carboxylated drugs (Oswald et al. 2016). After ligand binding, a proton may bind to an acidic residue(s) in the transmembrane domain, i.e., Asp407 or Asp408, within the putative network of electrostatically interacting residues, which also include Lys940 and Thr978, and this may initiate a series of conformational changes that result in drug expulsion (Su et al. 2006). His978 is probably on the H+ pathway (Takatsuka and Nikaido 2006). AcrAB-TolC segregates to the old pole following cell division, causing the two daughter cells to exhibit different drug resistances (Bergmiller et al. 2017). The hoisting-loop is a highly flexible hinge that enables conformational energy transmission (Zwama et al. 2017). AcrB exhibits three distinct conformational states in the transport cycle, substrate access, binding, and extrusion, or loose (L), tight (T), and open (O) states, respectively (Yue et al. 2017). Simulations show that both Asp407 and Asp408 are deprotonated in the L/T states, while only Asp408 is protonated in the O state. Release of a proton from Asp408 in the O state results in large conformational changes.  Simulations offer dynamic details of how proton release drives the O-to-L transition in AcrB (Yue et al. 2017).  The three-dimensional structures of the homo-trimer complexes of AcrB-like transporters, and a three-step functional rotation helps to explain the mechanism of transport, but a more comprehensive model has been proposed (Zhang et al. 2017). Preparation of the trimeric complex (AcrAB/TolC) for cryo EM has been described (Du et al. 2018). The structural and energetic basis behind coupling functional rotation to proton translocation has been presented (Matsunaga et al. 2018). Protonation of  transmembrane Asp408 in the drug-bound protomer drives rotation. The conformational pathway identifies vertical shear motions among several transmembrane helices, which regulate alternate access of water as well as peristaltic motions that pump drugs into the periplasm (Matsunaga et al. 2018). CryoEM of detergent-free AcrB preserves lipid-protein interactions for visualization and reveals how the lipids pack against the protein (Qiu et al. 2018). In the presence of translation-inhibiting antibiotics, resistance 
acquisition depends on the AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump, because it 
reduces tetracycline concentrations in the cell. Protein synthesis can 
thus persist and TetA expression can be initiated immediately after 
plasmid acquisition. AcrAB-TolC efflux activity can also preserve 
resistance acquisition by plasmid transfer in the presence of 
antibiotics with other modes of action (Nolivos et al. 2019). Multiple transport pathways within AcrB are tuned to substrate physicochemical properties related to the polyspecificity of the pump (Tam et al. 2019). The cryoEM structure of AcrB in an artificial membrane at 3.9 Å resolution has been solved (Yao et al. 2020). The indole-dependent transport mechanism has been examined (Jewel et al. 2020). AcrB subunits rimerize to form the minimal functional unit, stabilized noncovalently by helix-helix interactions between TMS 1 and TMS 8. Peptides resembling these two TMSs inhibit subunit associations and drug export activity (Jesin et al. 2020). AcrB cycles between three functionally interdependent protomers through the loose (L), tight (T) and open (O) states during cooperative catalysis. Tam et al. 2021 presented 13 X-ray structures of AcrB in intermediate states of the transport cycle. Structure-based mutational analysis combined with drug susceptibility assays indicated that drugs are guided through dedicated transport channels toward the drug binding pockets. A co-structure obtained in the combined presence of erythromycin, linezolid, oxacillin and fusidic acid showed binding of fusidic acid deeply inside the T protomer transmembrane domain. Thiol cross-link substrate protection assays indicated that this transmembrane domain-binding site can also accommodate oxacillin or novobiocin but not erythromycin or linezolid. AcrB-mediated drug transport is suggested to be allosterically modulated in the presence of multiple drugs (Tam et al. 2021). Phenylalanine-arginine β-naphthylamide (PAβN) is an inhibitor of efflux pumps, including AcrAB, in Gram-negative bacteria (Al-Marzooq et al. 2023). Acacia senegal budmunchiamines are adjuvants for rejuvenating phenicol activities towards Escherichia coli-AcrAB-mediated  drug resistant strains (Dofini Magnini et al. 2023). Pyridylpiperazine-based inhibitors of AcrAB have been characterized (Plé et al. 2022). Comparative reassessment of AcrB efflux inhibitors reveals differential impact of specific pump mutations on the activity of potent compounds (Schuster et al. 2024).",{'secretion'},sym,['h'],-->,"{'8150': 'phospholipid', '3098': 'bile acid', '42478': 'ethidium', '26764': 'steroid hormone', '48219': 'disinfectant', '27780': 'detergent', '23888': 'drug', '37958': 'dye'}","{'8150': set(), '3098': {'bilea'}, '42478': set(), '26764': set(), '48219': set(), '27780': set(), '23888': set(), '37958': set()}",R_2_A_6_2_2,"{'8150': set(), '3098': {'bilea_c + h_c --> bilea_e + h_e'}, '42478': set(), '26764': set(), '48219': set(), '27780': set(), '23888': set(), '37958': set()}"

vertical tunnel extending down contiguously from the outer membrane surface to the periplasmic end in the open conformational state of this channel (Lei et al. 2014). Coordination of substrate binding and protonation in MtrD controls the functionally rotating transport mechanism (Fairweather et al. 2021). The amino acyl sequence, N917-P927, plays a key role in modulating substrate access to the binding cleft and influences the overall orientation of the protein within the inner membrane necessary for optimal functioning (Chitsaz et al. 2021).",{'secretion'},sym,['h'],-->,"{'4984': 'fatty acid', '3098': 'bile acid'}","{'4984': set(), '3098': {'bilea'}}",R_2_A_6_2_5,"{'4984': set(), '3098': {'bilea_c + h_c --> bilea_e + h_e'}}"

MexCD-OprJ is one of four primary drug exporters in P. aeruginosa (Lorusso et al. 2022). Collateral sensitivity (CS) is an evolutionary trade-off traditionally 
linked to the mutational acquisition of antibiotic resistance (AR) (Hernando-Amado et al. 2023). 
However, AR can be temporally induced. Mutational 
acquisition of ciprofloxacin resistance leads to robust CS to tobramycin
 in pre-existing antibiotic-resistant mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
 Further, the strength of this phenotype is higher when nfxB mutants, 
over-producing the efflux pump MexCD-OprJ, are selected. Hernando-Amado et al. 2023 induced
 transient nfxB-mediated ciprofloxacin resistance by using the 
antiseptic dequalinium chloride. Notably, non-inherited induction of AR 
renders transient tobramycin CS in the analyzed antibiotic-resistant 
mutants and clinical isolates, including tobramycin-resistant isolates. 
Further, by combining tobramycin with dequalinium chloride we drive 
these strains to extinction. Our results support that transient CS could
 allow the design of new evolutionary strategies to tackle 
antibiotic-resistant infections, avoiding the acquisition of AR 
mutations on which inherited CS depends (Hernando-Amado et al. 2023). The type of quinolone resistance mechanism is related to the frequency of
 MDRP and the risk of MDRP incidence is highly dependent on the 
order of exposure to gentamicin and ciprofloxacin (Yasuda et al. 2023).",{'secretion'},sym,['h'],-->,"{'31466': 'dequalinium chloride', '6440': 'levofloxacin', '3717': 'ciprofloxacin', '3603': 'chloramphenicol', '10426': 'beta-lactam', '3393': 'carbenicillin', '8232': 'piperacillin', '3508': 'ceftazidime', '3493': 'cefoperazone', '3486': 'cefepime', '2960': 'aztreonam', '9474': 'tetracycline', '9610': 'tobramycin', '87211': 'fluoroquinolone antibiotic', '25106': 'macrolide', '4841': 'erythromycin A', '2955': 'azithromycin'}","{'31466': set(), '6440': set(), '3717': set(), '3603': {'cm'}, '10426': set(), '3393': set(), '8232': set(), '3508': set(), '3493': set(), '3486': set(), '2960': set(), '9474': {'ttrcyc'}, '9610': set(), '87211': set(), '25106': set(), '4841': set(), '2955': set()}",R_2_A_6_2_15,"{'31466': set(), '6440': set(), '3717': set(), '3603': {'cm_c + h_c --> cm_e + h_e'}, '10426': set(), '3393': set(), '8232': set(), '3508': set(), '3493': set(), '3486': set(), '2960': set(), '9474': {'ttrcyc_c + h_c --> ttrcyc_e + h_e'}, '9610': set(), '87211': set(), '25106': set(), '4841': set(), '2955': set()}"

The first periplasmic domain of SecDF has been crystallized (Echizen et al., 2011) as has the intact SecDF complex (Tsukazaki and Nureki 2011). SecDF has been reported to function as a pmf-driven H+ transporter that facilitates protein translocation (Tsukazaki et al. 2011).  It may assume at least two conformations
differing by a 120 degrees rotation during polypeptide translocation (Mio et al. 2014). SecDF is proposed to undergo repeated conformational transitions to pull
 out the precursor protein from the SecYEG channel into the periplasm (Tsukazaki 2018). 
Once SecDF captures the precursor protein on the periplasmic surface, it can complete protein translocation even if SecA function is 
inactivated by ATP depletion, implying that SecDF is a 
protein-translocation motor that works independent of SecA. Structural 
and functional analyses of SecDF suggested that SecDF utilizes 
the proton gradient and interacts with precursor proteins in the flexible
 periplasmic region. The crystal structures of SecDF in different states

Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations combined with umbrella sampling, Ficici et al. 2017 studied the P1-head conformational change and how it is coupled to the pmf. They reported potentials of mean force along a root-mean-square-distance-based reaction coordinate obtained in the presence and absence of the TM electrical potential. Their results showed that the interaction of the P1 domain dipole moment with the TM electrical field lowers the free-energy barrier in the direction of the F-form to I-form transition, two conformations that vary by the relative positioning of the P1-head 
subdomain—the large periplasmic domain of TtSecDF—which is suggested to

Several classes of MmpL3 inhibitors have been developed against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) with potent anti-TB activity, one of which is the drug candidate SQ109. Yang et al. 2020 have determined crystal structures of MmpL3 in complex with 
NITD-349 and SPIRO. Both inhibitors bind deep in the central channel of

MmpL3 exports trehalose monomycolate (TMM), involved in mycolic acid donation to the cell wall core (Tahlan et al., 2012). SQ109, a 1,2,-diamine related to ethambutol  is an inhibitor of MmpL3 (Tahlan et al., 2012).  The system may also transport heme.  Inhibitors have been identified (Rayasam 2013; Li et al. 2014).  MmpL3 has been shown to be a homotrimer of three 12 TMS subunits, confirming its RND-type structure (Belardinelli et al. 2016).  MmpL3 is a flipppase for mycolic acids, transporting them from the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane to the external side. A 1.5-diarylpyrrole compound, BM212, is a potent inhibitor (Xu et al. 2017). Inactivation of the mmpL3 gene in M. neoaurum increased the permeability of the outer membrane and allowed increased uptake of sterols for coversion to other sterols for industrial purposes. One such product is 22-hydroxy-23,24-bisnorchol-4-ene-3-one (4-HBC), used for the synthesis of various steroids in the industry (Xiong et al. 2017). Since iron deprivation decreases expression of the mmpL3 gene, a metal chelation strategy could boost the effectiveness of current anti-TB drug regimes to combat drug resistant TB (Pal et al. 2018). Crystal structures are available for MmpL3 alone and in complex with four TB drug candidates. MmpL3 consists of a periplasmic pore domain and a twelve-helix transmembrane domain. Two Asp-Tyr pairs centrally located in this domain appear to facilitate proton-translocation. SQ109, AU1235, ICA38, and rimonabant bind inside the transmembrane region and disrupt these Asp-Tyr pairs (Zhang et al. 2019). MmpL3 can be directly inhibited by several antitubercular compounds (Li et al. 2019). Yang et al. 2020 have determined crystal structures of MmpL3 in complex with 
NITD-349 and SPIRO. Both inhibitors bind deep in the central channel of 
the transmembrane (TM) domain and cause conformational changes to the 
protein. The amide nitrogen and indole nitrogen of NITD-349 and the 
piperidine nitrogen of SPIRO interact and clamp Asp645. Analysis of the two structures reveals that these inhibitors target the 
proton relay pathway to block the activity of MmpL3 (Yang et al. 2020). The  (MmpL3) transporter is required for shuttling the lipid trehalose monomycolate (TMM), a precursor of mycolic acid (MA)-containing trehalose dimycolate (TDM) and mycolyl arabinogalactan peptidoglycan (mAGP), in Mycobacterium species, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis. It  facilitates the transport of fatty acids and lipidic elements to the mycobacterial cell wall. Su et al. 2021 reported 7 structures of the M. smegmatis MmpL3 transporter in its unbound state and in complex with trehalose 6-decanoate (T6D) or TMM using single-particle cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography. Combined with calculated results from molecular dynamics (MD) and target MD simulations, they revealed a lipid transport mechanism that involves a coupled movement of the periplasmic domain and transmembrane helices of the MmpL3 transporter that facilitates the shuttling of lipids to the mycobacterial cell wall (Su et al. 2021). Antibacterial compounds that target MmpL3 called ST004, have been identified and studied, showing that this compound strongly inhibits growth, and the cryoEM structure of MmpL3 with ST004 bound has been determined (Hu et al. 2022). PgfA (MSMEG_0317; TC# 1.B.163.1.9), a periplasmic protein that interacts with MmpL3, is a key determinant of polar growth and cell envelope composition 
in mycobacteria, and the LamA-mediated recruitment of this protein 
to one side of the cell is a required step in the establishment of 
cellular asymmetry (Gupta et al. 2022). Mycobacterial membrane protein large 3 (MmpL3) is an essential mycolic 
acid and lipid transporter required for growth and cell viability, and its function and inhibition have been reviewed (Williams and Abramovitch 2023). A continuous water pathway through the transmembrane region has been proposed, illustrating a putative pathway for protons. TMM can diffuse from 
the membrane into a binding pocket in MmpL3 spontaneously. Acetylation of TMM, which is required for transport, makes it more
 stable within MmpL3's periplasmic cavity compared to the unacetylated 
form (Li et al. 2023).  Equilibrium simulations revealed that trehalose monosmycolate can diffuse from the membrane into a binding pocket in MmpL3 spontaneously. Acetylation of TMM, which is required for transport, makes it more stable within MmpL3's periplasmic cavity (Li et al. 2023). Consistent with the close-open motion of the two PD domains, TMM entry 
size changes in the apo system, likely loading and moving the TMM, but 
it does not vary much in the holo system and probably impairs the movement 
of the TMM (Carbone et al. 2023). Water molecules passed through
 the central channel of the MmpL3 transporter to the cytoplasmic side in
 the apo system but not in the holo system, with a mean passing time of 
∼135 ns. Because water wires play an essential role in transporting 
protons, these findings shed light on the importance of the PMF in driving the
 close-open motion of the two TMSs. The key channel
 residues involved in water passage display considerable overlap with 
conserved residues within the MmpL protein family, supporting their 
critical functional role (Carbone et al. 2023). The  inhibitory mechanism of anti-TB drug SQ109 involves the allosteric inhibition of TMM translocation by MmpL3 (Carbone et al. 2023).",{'uptake'},sym,['h'],-->,"{'5584': 'hydron', '5585': 'water', '25438': 'mycolic acid', '60486': 'trehalose monomycolate'}","{'5584': {'h'}, '5585': {'h2o'}, '25438': {'mycolate'}, '60486': set()}",R_2_A_6_5_6,"{'5584': set(), '5585': {'h2o_e + h_e --> h2o_c + h_c'}, '25438': {'mycolate_e + h_e --> mycolate_c + h_c'}, '60486': set()}"

This pump confers resistance to a wide range of disinfectants and dyes known as quaternary cation compounds (QCCs). The 3-D structure of the dimeric EmrE shows opposite orientation of the two subunits in the membrane (Chen et al., 2007), and this conclusion has been confirmed (Fleishman et al. 2006; Lehner et al. 2008; Lloris-Garcerá et al. 2013). There may be a single intermediate state in which the substrate is occluded and immobile (Basting et al., 2008).  Direct interaction between substrates (tetraphenylphosphonium, TPP+ and MTP+) and Glu14 in TMS1 has been demonstrated using solid state NMR (Ong et al. 2013).  A Gly90X6Gly97 motif is important for dimer formation (Elbaz et al., 2008).  Two models may account for the opposite (inverted) orientations of the two identical subunits. A post-translational model posits that topology remains malleable after synthesis and becomes fixed once the dimer forms. A second, co-translational model, posits that the protein inserts in both topologies in equal proportions (Woodall et al. 2015).  Protonation of E14 leads to rotation and tilt of transmembrane helices 1-3 in conjunction with repacking of loops, conformational changes that alter the coordination of the bound substrate and modulate its access to the binding site from the lipid bilayer. The transport model that emerges posits a proton-bound, but occluded, resting state. Substrate binding from the inner leaflet of the bilayer releases the protons and triggers alternating access between inward- and outward-facing conformations of the substrate-loaded transporter, thus enabling antiport without dissipation of the proton gradient (Dastvan et al. 2016). TMS4 is the known dimerization domain of EmrE (Julius et al. 2017). Few conserved residues are essential for drug polyselectivity. Aromatic QCC selection involves a greater portion of conserved residues compared to other QCCs (Saleh et al. 2018).     The topologies of helical membrane proteins are generally defined during insertion of the transmembrane
helices, yet topology can change after insertion. In EmrE, topology flipping occurs so that the populations in both orientations equalize. Woodall et al. 2017 demonstrated that when EmrE is forced to insert in a distorted topology, topology
flipping of the first TMS can occur, and
topological malleability also extends to the C-terminal helix; even complete
inversion of the entire EmrE protein can occur after the full protein is translated and inserted.
Thus, topological rearrangements appear to be possible during biogenesis. Subtle but significant differences in the sizes of EmrE with different QCC ligands bound has been reported (Qazi and Turner 2018). The two Glu14 residues in the dimer have independent pKa values and are not electrostatically coupled (Li et al. 2021). High level cell-free expression and specific labeling of EmrE has been achieved (Klammt et al. 2004). Cotranslational folding and assembly of the dimeric E. coli EmrE has been documented (Mermans et al. 2022). Harmane binding can uncoupled proton flux through EmrE. In E. coli, EmrE-mediated dissipation of the transmembrane pH gradient provides the mechanism underlying the in vivo phenotype of harmane susceptibility (Spreacker et al. 2022).",{'secretion'},,,,{},{},R_2_A_7_1_3,{}

The thrid TMS in YidC contacts the substrate protein (Yu et al., 2008).  YidC occupies the lateral gate of the SecYEG translocase and is sequentially displaced by the nascent membrane protein (Sachelaru et al. 2013).  Residues involved in interaction with the Sec translocon have been identified (Li et al. 2014). YidC acts as a flexible chaperone,
facilitating LacY folding (Zhu et al. 2013; Hennon and Dalbey 2014).  The structure of the dimeric insertion pore associated with the translating ribosome has been solved (Kohler et al. 2009).  A single copy of YidC interacts with the ribosome at the ribosomal tunnel; a site for membrane protein insertion at the YidC protein-lipid interface has been identified (Wickles et al. 2014).  The crystal structure of full-length E. coli YidC revealed
that a hydrophilic groove, formed by five transmembrane helices, is a conserved structural feature as compared to the previous YidC structure from Bacillus halodurans, which lacks a
periplasmic domain. Structural mapping of the substrate- or Sec protein-contact sites suggested the
importance of the groove for the YidC functions as a chaperone and an insertase (Kumazaki et al. 2014). Pf3 is inserted as a helical hairpin, i.e., the prospective TMS moves 
along the YidC greasy slide comprised of TMS3 and TMS5, whereas the 
N-terminal tail transiently folds back into the hydrophilic groove of 
YidC located in the inner leaflet of the membrane until it is 
translocated to the periplasm in a subsequent step involving the pmf (He et al. 2020). YidC from E. coli forms an ion-conducting pore upon activation by ribosomes (Hennon and Dalbey 2014).  The structure of the dimeric insertion pore associated with the translating ribosome has been solved (Kohler et al. 2009).

along the YidC greasy slide comprised of TMS3 and TMS5, whereas the 
N-terminal tail transiently folds back into the hydrophilic groove of 
YidC located in the inner leaflet of the membrane until it is 
translocated to the periplasm in a subsequent step involving the pmf (He et al. 2020). YidC from E. coli forms an ion-conducting pore upon activation by ribosomes (Knyazev et al. 2023).",{'uptake'},,,,{'8526': 'protein polypeptide chain'},{'8526': set()},R_2_A_9_3_1,{'8526': set()}

BetP is a transporter with three different functions: betaine transport, osmosensing, and osmoregulation (Krämer and Morbach 2004).  The x-ray structure is known (3PO3; 2WIT; Ressl et al., 2009). Regulatory crosstalk in the trimeric BetP has been reported (Gärtner et al., 2011). An extracellular K+ -dependent interaction site modulates betaine-binding (Ge et al., 2011). The porter is trimeric and exhibits structural asymmetry (Tsai et al., 2011). The C-terminal domain is involved in osmosensing and is trimeric like wild-type BetP.  The two Na+  binding sites are between TMSs 1 and 8 in the first and second 5 TMS repeats, and between the equivalent TMSs 6 and 3 in the second and first repeats, respectively (Khafizov et al. 2012). interdependent binding of betaine and two sodium ions is observed during the coupling 
process. All three sites undergo progressive reshaping and dehydration 
during the alternating-access cycle, with the most optimal coordination 
of all substrates found in the closed state (Perez et al. 2014). BetP is active and regulated only when negatively charged lipids such as phosphatidyl glycerol are present, and the mechanism has been discussed (Güler et al. 2016).  The K+-sensing
C-terminal domain results in K+-dependent cooperative betaine-binding (Ge et al. 2011). BetP is a homotrimer lacking exact 3-fold symmetry. The observed differences may be due to crystal packing, or they may reflect different functional states of the transporter, related to osmosensing and osmoregulation (Ziegler et al. 2004). Intracellular K+ alters the conformation of the disordered C- and N-terminal domains to allosterically reconfigure TMSs 3, 8 and 10 to enhance betaine interactions. A map of the betaine binding site, at near single amino acid resolution, revealed a critical extrahelical H-bond mediated by TMS3 with betaine (Tantirimudalige et al. 2022). Both the N- and C-terminal (45 aas) segments participate in autoregulation, transducing changes in K+ concentrations as well as lipid bilayer properties to the integral membrane part of the protein. The C-terminal segment has short helical elements and an orientation that confines interactions (Leone et al. 2022).",{'uptake'},,,,"{'8345': 'potassium(1+)', '3073': 'glycine betaine'}","{'8345': {'k'}, '3073': {'glyb'}}",R_2_A_15_1_10,"{'8345': set(), '3073': set()}"

LeuT possesses two ion binding sites, NA1 and NA2, both highly specific for Na+ but with differing mechanisms of binding (Noskov and Roux, 2008). X-ray structures have been determined for LeuT in substrate-free outward-open and apo inward-open states (Krishnamurthy and Gouaux, 2012).  Extracytoplasmic substrate binding at an allosteric site controls activity (Zhao et al. 2011).  It has been proposed that the 5 TMS repeat derived from a DedA domain (9.B.27; Khafizov et al. 2010).  Mechanistic aspect of Na+ binding have been studied (Perez and Ziegler 2013).  Structural studies of mutant LeuT proteins suggest how antidepressants bind to biogenic amine transporters (Wang et al. 2013).  The detailed mechanism was studied by Zhao and Noskov, 2013.  Uptake involves movement of the substrate amino acid from the outward facing binding site, S1, to the inward facing binding site, S2, coupled with confrmational changes in the protein (Cheng and Bahar 2013).  The complete substrate translocation pathway has been proposed (Cheng and Bahar 2014). The inward facing conformation of LeuT has been solved (Grouleff et al. 2015).  Substrate-induced unlocking of the inner gatemay determinethe catalytic efficiency of the transporter (Billesbølle et al. 2015). Of the two Na+ binding sites, occupation of Na2 stabilizes outward-facing conformations
presumably through a direct interaction between Na+ and transmembrane helices 1 and 8 whereas Na+ binding at Na1 influences conformational change through a network of intermediary interactions (Tavoulari et al. 2015). TMS1A movements revealed a substantially different inward-open conformation in lipid bilayer from that inferred
from the crystal structure, especiallly with respect to the inner vestibule (Sohail et al. 2016). Partial unwinding of transmembrane helices 1, 5, 6 and7 drives LeuT from a substrate-bound, outward-facing occluded conformation toward an inward-facing open state (Merkle et al. 2018). A conserved tyrosine residue in the substrate binding site is required for substrate binding to convert LeuT to inward-open states by establishing an interaction between the two transporter domains (Zhang et al. 2018). The X-ray structure of LeuT in an inward-facing occluded conformation has revealed the mechanism of substrate release (Gotfryd et al. 2020). This involves a major tilting of the cytoplasmic end of TMS5, which, together with release of the N-terminus but without coupled movement of TM1) opens a wide cavity towards the second Na+ binding site. The X-ray structure of LeuT in an inward-facing occluded conformation has been solved, revealing the mechanism of substrate release (Gotfryd et al. 2020).",{'uptake'},,,,{},{},R_2_A_22_4_2,{}

These structures provide insight into the cytoplasmic release of Na+.
 The switch from outward- to inward-oriented states is centered on the 
partial unwinding of transmembrane helix 5, facilitated by a conserved 
GlyX9Pro motif that opens an intracellular pathway for water 
to access the Na+2 site. Solvation through this TMS 5 pathway may 
facilitate Na+ release from the Na+2 site to the inward-open state (Malinauskaite et al. 2014). TMS5 plays a role in the binding and release of Na+ from the Na+2 site and in mediating conformational changes (Stolzenberg et al. 2017). MhsT of Bacillus halodurans is a transporter of hydrophobic amino acids and a homologue of the eukaryotic SLC6 family of Na+ -dependent symporters for amino acids, neurotransmitters, osmolytes, and creatine. A non-helical region in TMS 6 of hydrophobic amino acid transporter MhsT mediates substrate recognition (Focht et al. 2020).",{'uptake'},,,,"{'49766': 'sodium(1+)', '25512': 'neurotransmitter'}","{'49766': {'na1'}, '25512': set()}",R_2_A_22_5_3,"{'49766': set(), '25512': set()}"

TMSs VI and VII are absent from many homologues, are not required for transport or its regulation and function in assembly and stability (Padan et al. 2015). pH-induced conformational changes have been documented (Kozachkov et al. 2007).  Two acidic residues in the binding site that carries the protons in electrogenic CPAs, and a polar residue in the unwound transmembrane helix 4 that determines ion selectivity have been identified. A rationally designed triple mutant successfully converted the electrogenic EcNhaA, to be electroneutral (Masrati et al. 2018). Residues involved in NhaA function have been reviewed (Dwivedi 2020).",{'uptake'},,,,"{'9175': 'sodium(1+)', '24636': 'proton'}","{'9175': {'na1'}, '24636': {'h'}}",R_2_A_33_1_1,"{'9175': set(), '24636': set()}"

NMR titration experiments showed that the protein binds ATP through its N-terminal domain (Orriss et al. 2020). Modified amiloride analogs with promising binding properties have been developed.

The structure is spatially arranged into a core domain and a gate domain. Uracil, located at the interface between the two domains, is coordinated mainly by residues from the core domain. Structural analysis suggests that alternating access of the substrate may be achieved through conformational changes of the gate domain.

In mammals, the concentrative uptake of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) by members of the NAT family is driven by the Na+ gradient, while the uptake of nucleobases in bacteria is powered by the H+ gradient. The structure of PurC has been determined at 2.80 Å resolution (Weng et al. 2023). PurTCp forms a homodimer, and each protomer has 14 
transmembrane segments folded into a transport domain (core domain) and a
 scaffold domain (gate domain). A purine base is present in the 
structure and defines the location of the substrate binding site. 
Functional studies reveal that PurTCp transports purines but 
not pyrimidines and that purine binding and transport is dependent on 
the pH. Mutation of a conserved aspartate residue close to the substrate
 binding site reveals the critical role of this residue in H+-dependent transport of purines. Comparison of the PurTCp structure with transporters of the same structural fold suggests that 
rigid-body motions of the substrate-binding domain are central for 
substrate translocation across the membrane (Weng et al. 2023).",{'uptake'},sym,['na1'],-->,"{'8639': '7H-purine', '2472': 'adenosine', '5564': 'guanosine'}","{'8639': set(), '2472': {'adn'}, '5564': {'gsn'}}",R_2_A_46_1_11,"{'8639': set(), '2472': {'adn_e + na1_e --> adn_c + na1_c'}, '5564': {'gsn_e + na1_e --> gsn_c + na1_c'}}"

The x-ray structure has been determined (PDB 1OTS) Dutzler et al., 2002, 2003). The exchange mechanism involves a conformational cycle of alternating exposure of Cl- and 
H+ binding sites of both ClC pores to the two sides of the membrane (Miloshevsky et al., 2010). Specific aspects of these conformational changes have been proposed (Wang et al. 2018).  Although the protein is present as a homodimer, a single ClC subunit alone is the basic functional unit for transport, and cross-subunit interaction is not required for Cl-/H+ exchange in ClC transporters (Robertson et al., 2010).  Glu202 is essential for H+ symport and is on the H+ pathway (Lim et al. 2012).  CLC exchangers have two gates that are coupled through conformational
rearrangements outside the ion pathway (Basilio et al. 2014).  The rotation of E148 plays a critical role in defining the Cl-/H+ coupling (Lee et al. 2016). The channel shows conserved re-entrant helix-coil-helix domains (Tsirigos et al. 2017). Proton transport  is intrinsically coupled to protein cavity hydration changes and is influenced by the protein environment (Wang et al. 2018). EriC also transports fluoride (F-) (Baker et al. 2012).

DltB contains a ring of 11 peripheral transmembrane helices, which shield a highly conserved extracellular structural funnel extending into the middle of the lipid bilayer. The conserved catalytic histidine residue is located at the bottom of this funnel and is connected to the intracellular DltC (acyl carrier protein) through a narrow tunnel. Mutation of either the catalytic histidine or the DltC-binding site of DltB abolishes D-alanylation of lipoteichoic acid and sensitizes Bacillus subtilis to cell-wall stress, which suggests cross-membrane catalysis involving the tunnel.

SiaQ and SiaM form a 1:1 stoichiometric complex (Mulligan et al., 2012).  The structure of a Vibrio ortholog has been determined by cryoEM (Peter et al. 2022). The protein complex is composed of 16 TMSs in SiaQ (4 TMSs) and SiaM (12 TMSs) that are structurally related to multimeric elevator-type transporters. The idiosyncratic Q-domain of TRAP transporters enables the formation of a monomeric elevator architecture.  A model of the tripartite PQM complex is experimentally validated and reveals the coupling of the substrate-binding P protein to the transporter domains. Peter et al. 2022 studied the formation of the tripartite complex and investigated the impact of interface mutants.

consisting of helical hairpins as seen in the sodium ion-coupled 
elevator transporter VcINDY. The SiaQ protein forms intimate contacts 
with SiaM to extend the size of the scaffold domain, suggesting that 
TRAP transporters may operate as monomers, rather than the typically 
observed oligomers for elevator-type transporters. Davies et al. 2023 identified the Na+ and sialic acid binding sites in SiaM  from Photobacterium profundum at 2.97 Å resolution and demonstrated a strict 
dependence on the substrate-binding protein SiaP for uptake. They reported
the SiaP crystal structure that, together with docking studies, suggested 
the molecular basis for how sialic acid is delivered to the SiaQM

4472,2.A.64.1.1,Bacteria,Pseudomonadota,TatABCE translocase,"TatABCE translocase. Early contacts between substrate proteins and TatA have been demonstrated (Fröbel et al., 2011). TatC helix 5 and the TatB transmembrane helix interact (Kneuper et al., 2012).  TatC functions as an obligate oligomer (Cleon et al. 2015). TatA is the most abundant component of the complex and facilitates assembly of this complex.It exhibits a uniform distribution throughout the inner membrane, but forms linear clusters upon increased expression of TatBC (Smith et al. 2017).  TatA and TatB both have the capacity to bind at two TatC sites, one in TMS5 and one in TMS6 (Habersetzer et al. 2017). However in vivo this is regulated according to the activation state of the complex. In the resting-state system, TatB binds the polar cluster site in TMS 5 with TatA occupying the site in TMS 6. However, when the system is activated by overproduction of a substrate, TatA and TatB switch binding sites. Habersetzer et al. 2017 proposed that this substrate-triggered positional exchange is a key step in the assembly of an active Tat translocase. A  highly conserved glutamate residue in the transmembrane region of E. coli TatC, which, when modified by DCCD, interferes with the deep insertion of a Tat signal peptide into the TatBC receptor complex (Blümmel et al. 2017). Different from TatA but rather like TatB, TatE contacts a Tat signal peptide independently of the proton-motive force and restricts the premature processing of a Tat signal peptide (Eimer et al. 2018). Furthermore, TatE embarks at the transmembrane helix five of TatC where it becomes so closely spaced to TatB that both proteins can be covalently linked by a zero-space cross-linker. This suggests that in addition to TatB and TatC, TatE is a component of the Tat substrate receptor complex. A bioinformatic analysis revealed a relatively broad distribution of tatE genes in bacterial phyla and highlights unique protein sequence features of TatE orthologs (Eimer et al. 2018). A TatA/TatB binding site on the TatC component of the E. coli Tat tanslocase has been identified (Severi et al. 2023).",{'uptake'},,,,{},{},R_2_A_64_1_1,{}

plane of the membrane (Butler et al. 2013). MurJ has 14 TMSs, and specific charged residues localized in the central cavity are essential for
function. This structural homology model suggests that MurJ functions as an essential transporter in PG biosynthesis (Butler et al. 2013). Based on an in vivo assay, MurJ is a flippase for the lipid-linked cell wall precursors, polyisoprenoid-linked disaccharide-peptapeptides (Sham et al. 2014).  There is controversy about the role of this porter and FtsW/RodA which on the basis of an in vitro assay, were thought to be flippases for the same intermediate (Young 2014). MurJ, the bacterial lipid II flippase, functions by an alternating-access mechanism (Kumar et al. 2019). The crystal structure of MurJ in a ""squeezed"" form, distinct from its inward- and outward-facing forms, has been published (Kohga et al. 2022). These authors reported two crystal structures of inward-facing forms from Arsenophonus endosymbiont MurJ and a crystal structure of E. coli MurJ in a ""squeezed"" form, which lacks a cavity to accommodate the substrate, mainly because of the increased proximity of transmembrane helices 2 and 8. Molecular dynamics simulations support the hypothesis that the squeezed form is an intermediate conformation (Kohga et al. 2022).",{'uptake'},,,,{'28300': 'glutamine'},{'28300': {'gln__L'}},R_2_A_66_4_3,{'28300': set()}

activity than the AspT-WT (R76), whereas R76D and R76E have lower activity than AspT-WT. Thus, R76 is involved in AspT substrate transport (Suzuki et al. 2016).  AspT catalyzes self-exchange of aspartate and electrogenic heterologous 
exchange of aspartate with alanine. Thus, the asp operon confers a 
proton motive metabolic cycle consisting of the electrogenic 
aspartate-alanine antiporter and  aspartate decarboxylase, which 
keeps intracellular levels of alanine, the countersubstrate for 
aspartate, high (Abe et al. 2002). AspT has been reported to have a unique topology; 8 TMS, a large cytoplasmic loop (183 amino 
acids) between TMS5 and TMS6, and N- and C-termini that both face the 
periplasm. This may be a unique 2D-structure of AspT, a representative of the novel AAE family (Nanatani et al. 2005). However, bioinformatic analyses suggest that this prediction may be in error, and the true topology is 12 TMSs with an internal repeat of 6 TMSs (M. Saier, unpublished observations; see 2.A.81.2.1). The Km values = 0.35 mm for L-aspartate, 0.098 mm for 
D-aspartate, 26 mm for L-alanine, and 3.3 mm for 
D-alanine). Competitive inhibition by various amino acids of L-aspartate
 or L-alanine in self-exchange reactions revealed that L-cysteine 
selectively inhibited L-aspartate self-exchange but only weakly 
inhibited L-alanine self-exchange while L-serine selectively 
inhibited L-alanine self-exchange but barely inhibited L-aspartate 
self-exchange. The aspartate analogs L-cysteine sulfinic acid, L-cysteic
 acid, and D-cysteic acid competitively and strongly inhibited 
L-aspartate self-exchange compared with L-alanine self-exchange. Taken 
together, these kinetic data suggest that the putative binding sites of 
L-aspartate and L-alanine are independently located in the substrate 
translocation pathway of AspT (Sasahara et al. 2011).

High affinity thiamin transporter ThiT (Ka=120 pM). Other substrates include TPP, TMP and pyrithiamin with nM binding constants at 1:1 stoichiometry (protein:ligand). Binding depends on a tryptophan-rich loop between TMSs 5 and 6 (Erkens and Slotboom, 2010). Erkens et al. (2011) presented the crystal structure of the thiamine-specific S-component of the ECF-type ABC transporter, ThiT from Lactococcus lactis at 2.0 Å. Extensive protein-substrate interactions explain its high binding affinity for thiamine (Kd ~ 10-10 M). ThiT has a fold similar to that of the riboflavin-specific S-component RibU, with which it shares only 14% sequence identity. Two alanines in a conserved motif (AxxxA) located on the membrane-embedded surface of the S-components mediate the interaction with the energizing module. A general transport mechanism for ECF transporters has been proposed (Erkens et al., 2011).  Substrate binding induces conformational changes in ThiT (Majsnerowska et al. 2013).",{'uptake'},,,,"{'15797': '1-(4-amino-2-methylpyrimidin-5-ylmethyl)-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-methylpyridinium bromide', '9533': 'thiamine(1+) monophosphate', '9532': 'thiamine(1+) diphosphate', '9530': 'thiamine(1+)'}","{'15797': set(), '9533': {'thmmp'}, '9532': {'thmpp'}, '9530': {'thm'}}",R_2_A_88_3_2,"{'15797': set(), '9533': set(), '9532': set(), '9530': set()}"

glucose grown-cells, the ΔyaaH mutant is compromised for the uptake of 
both labelled acetic and succinic acids. YaaH, together with ActP, 
previously described as an acetate transporter, affect the use of acetic
 acid as a sole carbon and energy source. Both genes have to be deleted 
simultaneously to abolish acetate transport. The uptake of acetate and 
succinate was restored when yaaH was expressed in trans in ΔyaaH ΔactP cells. YaaH amino acid residues
 Leu131 and Ala164 are important for the enhanced ability to transport lactate (Sá-Pessoa et al. 2013).

Wu et al. 2019 suggested that channel opeining involves repacking of key residues, such as Gln50 and Phe17, as well as the subsequent outward movement of all transmembrane helices. Their simulations suggested that acetate is always surrounded by several water molecules when passing through the anion channel, and a high energy barrier of 15 kcal/mol was observed (Wu et al. 2019).

Deshpande et al. 2018 determined the crystal structure of Ca2+-bound BbFpn (TC# 2.A.100.2.1), and found that Ca2+ is a cofactor that facilitates a conformational change critical to the 
transport cycle. They also identified a substrate pocket accommodating a 
divalent transition metal complexed with a chelator. These findings

If 16 TMSs, they occur in a 2 + 2 + 5 + 2 (space) +1 + 3 + 1 TMS arrangement, or if 18 TMSs, there are two additional TMSs between the first11 TMSs and the last 5 TMSs. Regulated by Crp as well as the LytS-like histidine sensor kinase, BtsS (YehU) which senses extracellular pyruvate, and it functions with the corresponding LytTR-like response regulator, BtsR (YehT).  Although the true inducer is extracellular pyruvate as noted above, it is induced by peptides as cells enter the stationary growth phase, presumably because pyruvate is released from these peptides (Kraxenberger et al. 2012).  BtsT forms a complex with the MFS transporter, YhjX (TC# 2.A.1.11.3) and two sensor kinase/response regulator pairs, YehU/YehT and YdpA/YdpB (Behr et al. 2014).  Both transporters are also posttranscriptionally regulated by CsrA (Behr et al. 2014).  The LytS-type histidine kinase, BtsS, is a 7-transmembrane receptor that binds pyruvate (Qiu et al. 2023). The two proteins, YhjX (TC# 2.A.1.11.3) and YjiY (TC# 2.A.114.1.9) may

The globular domains of PbgA resemble the structures of the 
arylsulfatase protein family and contains a novel core hydrophobic 
pocket that may be responsible for binding and transporting cardiolipin (Dong et al. 2016).  PhoPQ is activated within the 
intracellular phagosome environment of the host animal, where it promotes remodeling of the
 outer membrane and resistance to innate immune antimicrobial peptides. 
Maintenance of the PhoPQ-regulated outer membrane barrier requires PbgA,
 an inner membrane protein with a transmembrane domain essential for 
growth, and a periplasmic domain required for PhoPQ-activated increases 
in outer membrane cardiolipin. Fan et al. 2020 reported the crystal structure of 
cardiolipin-bound PbgA, adopting a transmembrane fold that 
features a cardiolipin binding site in close proximity to a long and 
deep cleft spanning the lipid bilayer. The end of the cleft extends into
 the periplasmic domain of the protein, which is structurally coupled to
 the transmembrane domain via a functionally critical C-terminal helix. 
In conjunction with a conserved putative catalytic dyad situated at the 
middle of the cleft, structural and mutational analyses suggest that
 PbgA is a multifunction membrane protein that mediates cardiolipin 
transport, a function essential for growth, and perhaps catalysis of an 
unknown enzymatic reaction (Fan et al. 2020).",{'uptake'},,,,{'3411': 'cardiolipin'},{'3411': set()},R_2_A_127_1_1,{'3411': set()}

TolQ/R proteins are listed under TC# 1.A.30.2.2.  Proteins of the 
complex listed here are TolA, TolB, YbgF and Pal.  They play a role in 
outer membrane stabilization and uptake of colicins, but not energizaton
 of outer membrane receptors (OMRs: TC# 1.B.14).  May function in 
phospholipid transport (SS Chng, personal communication).  Cells lacking
 the Tol-Pal complex exhibit defects in lipid asymmetry and 
accumulate excess phospholipids (PLs) in the OM. This imbalance in OM 
lipids is due to defective retrograde PL transport in the absence of a 
functional Tol-Pal complex. Thus, cells ensure the assembly of a stable 
OM by maintaining an excess flux of PLs to the OM only to return the 
surplus to the inner membrane via transport mediated by the Tol-Pal 
complex (Shrivastava et al. 2017). 
 The specific function of the Tol-Pal complex may be to transport lipids
 from the outer leaflet of the outer membrane to the inner leaflet of 
the outer member. The Tol-Pal complex is essential to maintain polar 
localization of the MCP chemotaxis receptor complex (Santos et al. 2014). The Tol-Pal complex, energized by TolQRA, and using the outer membrane proteins, BtuB and OmpF as receptors, is responsible for the uptake of colicin ColE9 and other bacteriocins; in this process, the complex in the outer membrane bridges and immobilizes the complex components in the inner membrane (Rassam et al. 2018).",{'uptake'},,,,{'8150': 'phospholipid'},{'8150': set()},R_2_C_1_2_1,{'8150': set()}

5167,3.A.1.1.1,Bacteria,Pseudomonadota,Maltooligosaccharide porter,"Maltooligosaccharide porter. The 3-D structure has been reported by Oldham et al. (2007). An altering access mechanism has been suggested for the maltose transporter resulting from rigid-body rotations (Khare et al., 2009). The maltose-binding protein is open in the catalytic transition state for ATP hydrolysis during maltose transport (Austermuhle et al. 2004). Bordignon et al. (2010) and Schneider et al. (2012) reviewed the extensive knowledge available on MalEFGK2, its mode of action and its regulatory interactions.  The transporter sequesters the MalT transcriptional activator at the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane in the absence of the transport substrate (Richet et al. 2012).  The crystal structures of the transporter complex MBP-MalFGK2 bound with
 large malto-oligosaccharide in two different conformational states have also been determined. In 
the pretranslocation structure, Oldham et al. 2013 found that the transmembrane subunit 
MalG forms two hydrogen bonds with malto-oligosaccharide at the reducing
 end. In the outward-facing conformation, the transmrembrane subunit MalF
 binds three glucosyl units from the nonreducing end. These
 structural features explain why large modified malto-oligosaccharides are not
 transported by MalFGK2 despite their high binding affinity to MBP. In the transport cycle, substrate is channeled from MBP 
into the transmembrane pathway with a polarity such that both MBP and 
MalFGK2 contribute to the overall substrate selectivity of the system (Oldham et al. 2013).  Stabilization of the semi-open
MalK2 conformation by maltose-bound MBP is key to the coupling of maltose transport to ATP
hydrolysis in vivo, because it facilitates the progression of the MalK dimer from the open to the
semi-open conformation, from which it can proceed to hydrolyze ATP (Alvarez et al. 2015). Both the binding of MalE to the periplasmic side of the transmembrane complex and binding of ATP to MalK2 are necessary to facilitate the conformational change from the inward-facing state to the occluded state, in which MalK2 is completely dimerized (Hsu et al. 2017). An integrated transport mechanism of the maltose ABC importer has been proposed (Mächtel et al. 2019).",{'uptake'},abc,-,-->,"{'17593': 'maltooligosaccharide', '6668': 'maltose'}","{'17593': set(), '6668': {'malt'}}",R_3_A_1_1_1,"{'17593': set(), '6668': {'atp_c + h2o_c + malt_e --> malt_c + pi_c + h_c + adp_c'}}"

ABC transport system, AlgQ1AlgM1AlgM2(AlgS)2: AlgS, 363 aas, BAB03314; AlgQ1, 502 aas, 3VLW_A;  AlgM1, 324 aas, BAB03315.1; AlgM2, 293 aas, BAB03316.1. Sphingomonas species A1 is a 'pit-forming' bacterium that directly incorporates alginate into its cytoplasm through a pit-dependent transport system, termed a 'superchannel' (Murata et al., 2008). The pit is a novel organ acquired through the fluidity and reconstitution of cell surface molecules, and through cooperation with the transport machinery in the cells.  It confers upon bacterial cells a more efficient way to secure and assimilate macromolecules (Murata et al., 2008).  The substrate-transport characteristics and quaternary structure of AlgM1M2SS with AlgQ1 have been determined (Maruyama et al. 2015). The addition
of poly- or oligoalginate enhanced the ATPase activity of reconstituted AlgM1M2SS coupled with one
of the periplasmic solute-binding proteins, AlgQ1 or AlgQ2. External fluorescence-labeled
oligoalginates were specifically imported into AlgM1M2SS-containing proteoliposomes in the presence
of AlgQ2, ATP, and Mg2+. The crystal structure of AlgQ2-bound AlgM1M2SS adopts an inward-facing
conformation. The interaction between AlgQ2 and AlgM1M2SS induces the formation of an alginate-binding tunnel-like structure accessible to solvent. The translocation route inside the
transmembrane domains contains charged residues suitable for the import of acidic saccharides (Maruyama et al. 2015). 
This bacterium  is a Gram-negative rod, containing 
glycosphingolipids in the cell envelope, and is named Sphingomonas sp. 
strain A1 (Murata et al. 2022). The pit was dynamic, with repetitive opening and closing 
during growth on alginate, and directly included alginate concentrated 
around the pit, particularly by flagellins, alginate-binding proteins, 
localized on the cell surface. Alginate incorporated into the periplasm 
was subsequently transferred to the cytoplasm by cooperative 
interactions of periplasmic solute-binding proteins and an ATP-binding 
cassette transporter in the cytoplasmic membrane. The mechanisms of 
assembly, functions, and interactions between the above-mentioned 
molecules were clarified using structural biology. The pit was 
transplanted into other strains of sphingomonads, and the pitted 
recombinant cells were effectively applied to the production of 
bioethanol, bioremediation for dioxin removal (Murata et al. 2022). The outer membranes of Sphingomonas strains contain GSL and is 
different from that of other Gram-negative bacteria, which contain LPSs 
in their cell envelope. Because of this property, the cell 
surface of Sphingomonas strains is more hydrophobic than that 
of other Gram-negative bacteria and shows high affinity toward 
hydrophobic chemicals such as dioxin and polypropylene glycol.
Strain A1 cells use polyuronates (alginate and pectin) and 
their depolymerization products as carbon sources for growth. 
Glucose and pyruvate can be utilized as carbon sources, but far 
less efficiently than polyuronates.
 Strain A1 cells grew well on alginate and oligoalginates with different
 M/G ratios at pH 6–7, 30 ℃ in aerobic conditions, with a doubling time 
of approximately 25 min. However, unlike almost all of the 
alginate-degrading bacteria analyzed to date, the cells of 
strain A1 contained most of their alginate lyases in the cytoplasm. This
 means that alginate in the medium has to enter the cells in order to 
make contact with alginate lyases (Murata et al. 2022).
The morphological characteristics of the cell surface were examined with
 cells of strain A1 grown in the presence or absence of alginate. The following morphological observations were made (Murata et al. 2022): (i) cells grown on 
alginate were of two types that always coexisted in the medium: cells 
with or without a pit,
 and this feature was not observed in the absence of alginate. (ii) The 
surface of cells grown in the absence of alginate showed a pleat-like 
structure without a pit. (iii) Cells grown in the presence of alginate produced pits on their cell surface, and
 The pits contained even globular particles, some of which were 
insoluble forms (granules) of alginate. (iv) When the alginate-grown 
cells were treated with ruthenium red, an agent used to stain 
mucopolysaccharides, the pit periphery was strongly and specifically 
stained,
 suggesting that alginate was concentrated in the pit. (v) The thin 
section of cells grown on alginate showed a specific region where the 
cell surface sunk into the cells but no such structures were observed in cells grown in the absence of 
alginate. (vi) The average pit size was 0.02–0.1 µm in diameter (Murata et al. 2022). Thus,  (a) the pit is formed only in the presence of alginate, (b) the pit 
functions as a concentrator of alginate, and (c) strain A1 cells have a 
pit-dependent alginate assimilation system, which differs from the 
alginate import and degradation pathway of other alginate-degrading 
microbes.
There are six protein constituents in the ABC transporter: AlgQ1, Q2,
 M1 M2 and S (AlgS is present with two copies where Q1 and 2 are 
periplasmic binding proteins, M1 and M2 comprise the integral membrane 
transport channel, and S is the dimeric ATPase. Alginate accumulated in 
the pit is delivered into the periplasm and then
 transported to the cytoplasm by this ABC transporter. Alginate is 
finally degraded into constituent monosaccharides by alginate lyases 
present in the cytoplasm. The gene cluster encoding these proteins are 
AlgO (regulatory protein)-AlgS-AlgM1-AlgM2-AlgQ1-AlgQ2. There are 8 cell
 surface proteins, p1 - p8.  P1 - p4 are TonB-dependent outer membrane 
transporters; p5 and p6 are flagellin-like proteins with alterred 
central domains of ~150 aas and high affinity for alginate (Kd = 10-9), and p7 and p8 are periplasmic alginate binding proteins (Murata et al. 2022).",{'uptake'},abc,-,-->,{'271': 'alginic acid'},{'271': set()},R_3_A_1_1_10,{'271': set()}

The conformational transition pathways of BtuCD has been revealed by targeted molecular dynamics simulations (Weng et al., 2012). Asymmetric states of BtuCD are not discriminated by its cognate substrate binding protein BtuF (Korkhov et al., 2012).  ATP hydrolysis occurs at the nucleotide-binding domain
(NBD) dimer interface, whereas substrate translocation takes place at the
translocation pathway between the TM subunits, which is more than 30 angstroms away
from the NBD dimer interface.  Hydrolysis of ATP appears to facilitate substrate translocation by opening the
cytoplasmic end of translocation pathway (Pan et al. 2016). The molecular mechanism of ATP hydrolysis by BtuCD-F may proceeds in a stepwise manner (Prieß et al. 2018). First, nucleophilic attack of an activated lytic water molecule at the ATP gamma-phosphate yields ADP + HPO42-. A conserved glutamate located close to the gamma-phosphate transiently accepts a proton acting as a catalytic base. In the second step, the proton transfers back from the catalytic base to the gamma-phosphate, yielding ADP + H2PO4-. These two reaction steps are followed by rearrangements of the hydrogen bond network and the coordination of the Mg2+ ion. The overall free energy change of the reaction is close to zero, suggesting that ATP binding is essential for tight dimerization of the nucleotide-binding domains and the transition of the transmembrane domains from inward- to outward-facing. ATP hydrolysis resets the conformational cycle (Prieß et al. 2018).",{'uptake'},abc,-,-->,{'17439': 'cyanocob(III)alamin'},{'17439': set()},R_3_A_1_13_1,{'17439': set()}

two unique features: unwinding of a transmembrane helix in YbtP

IrtA contains an FAD-binding domain (Ryndak et al., 2010).  M. tuberculosis produces two classes of siderophores, lipid-bound mycobactin and water-soluble carboxymycobactin. Iron-loaded carboxymycobactin is imported into the cytoplasm by IrtAB which has an additional cytoplasmic siderophore interaction domain that may serve as a periplasmic receptor. Membrane-reconstituted IrtAB is sufficient for the import of mycobactins, which are then reduced by the siderophore interaction domain to facilitate iron release (Arnold et al. 2020). Structure determination by X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM not only confirmed that IrtAB has an ABC exporter fold (as indicated by TC-BLAST searches), but also revealed structural peculiarities at the transmembrane region of IrtAB that result in a partially collapsed inward-facing substrate-binding cavity. The siderophore interaction domain is positioned in close proximity to the inner membrane leaflet, enabling the reduction of membrane-inserted mycobactin. Enzymatic ATPase activity and in vivo growth assays revealed that IrtAB has a preference for mycobactin over carboxymycobactin as its substrate (Arnold et al. 2020). The large transporter (Rv1348-1349) of 859 aas seems to have three domains, an extracytoplasmic receptor domain (IrtA), a central membrane domain of 6 TMSs (IrtB) and a C-terminal ATPase (IrtC). If so, there may be two potential receptors (see Mandal et al. 2021 for a review). Cryo-EM structures for the M. tuberculosis iron-loaded siderophore transporter IrtAB has been reported (Sun et al. 2023). It adopts the canonical type IV exporter fold. The structures of unliganded Mtb IrtAB in complex with ATP, ADP, or the ATP analogue (AMP-PNP) at resolutions ranging from 2.8 to 3.5 Å. The structure of IrtAB bound ATP-Mg2+ shows a ""head-to-tail"" dimer of nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), a closed amphipathic cavity within the TMDs, and a metal ion liganded to three histidine residues of IrtA in the cavity. Cryo-EM structures and ATP hydrolysis assays showed that the NBD of IrtA has a higher affinity for nucleotides and increased ATPase activity compared with IrtB (Sun et al. 2023).",{'uptake'},abc,-,-->,{'62579': 'carboxymycobactin'},{'62579': set()},R_3_A_1_21_2,{'62579': set()}

Substrate binding (S) components rotate within the membrane to expose their binding pockets alternately to the exterior and the cytoplasm. In contrast to vitamin transporters, metal-specific systems rely on additional proteins with essential functions. CbiN, with two TMSs tethered by an extracytoplasmic loop of 37 amino-acid residues is the auxiliary component that temporarily interacts with the CbiMQO2 Co2+ transporter. CbiN induces Co2+ transport activity in the absence of CbiQO2 in cells producing the S component CbiM plus CbiN or a Cbi(MN) fusion. Finkenwirth et al. 2019 showed that any deletion in the CbiN loop abolished transport activity. Protein-protein contacts between segments of the CbiN loop and loops in CbiM were demonstrated, and an ordered structure of the CbiN loop was shown.

Conformational changes in MetQ provide substrate access through the binding protein to the transmembrane translocation pathway. MetQ likely mediates uptake of methionine derivatives through two mechanisms: in the methionine-bound form, substrate is delivered from the periplasm to the transporter (the canonical mechanism) and in the apo form, it facilitates ligand binding when complexed to the transporter (the noncanonical mechanism).

MlaA (VacJ) is a ""spreading"" protein, essential for Shigella pathogenicity (Suzuki et al., 1994).  The ABC transporter, MlaEFBD, provides energy for maintaining OM lipid asymmetry via the transport of 
aberrantly localized phospholipids (PLs) from the OM to the inner 
membrane (IM) (Thong et al. 2016). MlaD spans the periplasm, forms stable hexamers within the complex, functions in 
substrate binding with strong affinity for PLs within a channel that spans the periplasm, and modulates ATP 
hydrolytic activity. MlaB plays critical roles in both the 
assembly and activity of the transporter.  MlaA forms a complex with OmpC and OmpF in the outer membrane to extract PLs from the outer leaflet of the OM (Chong et al. 2015). MlaA is a monomeric 2 α-helical TMS OM protein that functions as a 
phospholipid translocation channel, forming a ~20-Å-thick doughnut 
embedded in the inner leaflet of the OM with a central, amphipathic 
pore (Abellón-Ruiz et al. 2017). This architecture prevents access of inner leaflet phospholipids 
to the pore, but allows outer leaflet phospholipids to bind to a pronounced ridge surrounding the 
channel. Members of the mammalian cell entry (MCE) protein family, one of which is MlaD, form hexameric 
assemblies with a central channel capable of mediating lipid transport across the periplasm (Ekiert et al. 2017). 
MlaD forms a ring associated with the ABC 
transporter complex in the inner membrane. A soluble lipid-binding 
protein, MlaC ferries lipids between MlaD and an outer membrane protein
 complex. EM structures of two other E. coli MCE proteins 
show that YebT (LetB) forms an elongated tube consisting of seven stacked MCE 
rings, and PqiB adopts a syringe-like architecture. Both YebT and PqiB 
create channels of sufficient length to span the periplasmic space. These homologs transport lipids between the two membranes of 
Gram-negative bacteria, some eukaryotic organelles and possibly actinobacteria (Ekiert et al. 2017). MCE systems mediate phospholipid trafficking across the periplasm. ~3.5 Å cryo-EM structures of the E. coli MCE protein 
LetB reveals an ~0.6 megadalton complex that consists of seven stacked 
rings, with a central hydrophobic tunnel sufficiently long to span the 
periplasm (Isom et al. 2020). Lipids bind inside the tunnel, suggesting that it functions 
as the pathway for lipid transport. Cryo-EM structures in the open and 
closed states revealed a dynamic tunnel lining with implications for 
gating and substrate translocation. These results support a model in which 
LetB establishes a physical link between the two membranes and creates a
 hydrophobic pathway for the translocation of lipids across the 
periplasm (Isom et al. 2020). The transmembrane subunit, MlaE, has minimal sequence similarity to other transporters. Coudray et al. 2020 reported the cryo-EM structure of MlaFEDB at 3.05 Å resolution, revealing distant relationships to the LPS and MacAB transporters, as well as members of the eukaryotic ABCA/ABCG families. A continuous transport pathway extends from the MlaE substrate- binding site, through the channel of MlaD, and into the periplasm. Two phospholipids are bound to MlaFEDB, suggesting that multiple lipid substrates may be transported each cycle. The structure provides mechanistic insight into substrate recognition and transport by MlaFEDB (Coudray et al. 2020). Structures of both the E. coli and P. aeruginosa MlaFEDB complexes have been determined by cryoEM (Zhou et al. 2021). The structures show that the MlaFEBD complex contains a total of twelve protein molecules with a stoichiometry of MlaF2E2B2D6, and binds a plethora of phospholipids (PLs) at different locations. In contrast to canonical ABC transporters, nucleotide binding fails to trigger significant conformational changes of both MlaFEBD and MlaFEB in the nucleotide-binding and transmembrane domains, correlated with their low ATPase activities exhibited in both detergent micelles and lipid nanodiscs. PLs or detergents appeared to relocate to the membrane-proximal end from the distal end of the hydrophobic tunnel formed by the MlaD hexamer in MlaFEBD upon addition of ATP, indicating that retrograde PL transport might occur in the tunnel in an ATP-dependent manner. Site-specific photocrosslinking experiment confirmed that the substrate-binding pocket in the dimeric MlaE and the MlaD hexamer are able to bind PLs in vitro, in line with the notion that the MlaFEBD complex functions as a PL transporter (Zhou et al. 2021).  Mla uses a shuttle-like mechanism to move lipids between the MlaFEDB 
inner membrane complex and the MlaA-OmpF/C OM complex, via a periplasmic
 lipid-binding protein, MlaC. MlaC binds to MlaD and MlaA (MacRae et al. 2023). They mapped the MlaC-MlaA and MlaC-MlaD protein-protein interfaces, suggesting that the MlaD and MlaA binding surfaces on MlaC overlap to a 
large extent, leading to a model in which MlaC can only bind one of 
these proteins at a time. Low-resolution cryo-EM maps of MlaC bound to MlaFEDB suggested that at least two MlaC 
molecules can bind to MlaD at once, in a conformation consistent with 
AlphaFold2 predictions (MacRae et al. 2023). The Mla system of the diderm Firmicute, Veillonella parvula, reveals an ancestral transenvelope bridge for phospholipid trafficking (Grasekamp et al. 2023).",{'uptake'},abc,-,-->,{'8150': 'phospholipid'},{'8150': set()},R_3_A_1_27_3,{'8150': set()}

The fact that there are six SBPs in each Mtb mce operon suggests that the MceA-F SBPs from Mce1-4 may form heterohexamers. The helical domains interact with the detergent micelle, suggesting that when assembled, the helical domains of MceA-F may form a hydrophobic pore for lipid transport, as observed in PqiB of E. coli (Asthana et al. 2021).",{'uptake'},abc,-,-->,"{'24024': 'fatty acid', '25438': 'mycolic acid'}","{'24024': set(), '25438': {'mycolate'}}",R_3_A_1_27_6,"{'24024': set(), '25438': {'atp_c + h2o_c + mycolate_e --> mycolate_c + pi_c + h_c + adp_c'}}"

Upon ATP binding, large structural changes within the nucleotide-binding and transmembrane regions push conserved hydrophobic residues at the substrate entry site towards the periplasm and provide a model for polysaccharide translocation. With ATP bound, the transporter forms a large transmembrane channel with openings toward the membrane and periplasm. The channel's periplasmic exit is sealed by detergent molecules that block solvent permeation.

structure is available (PDB 6AN7) (Bi et al. 2018) for the Wzm-Wzt homologue from Aquifex aeolicus in an open conformation. The transporter forms a transmembrane channel that is sufficiently wide to accommodate a linear polysaccharide. Its nucleotide-binding domain and a periplasmic extension form 'gate helices' at the cytosolic and periplasmic membrane interfaces that probably serve as substrate entry and exit points (Bi et al. 2018). O antigen structures are serotype specific and form extended cell surface barriers endowing many pathogens with survival benefits. In the ABC transporter-dependent biosynthesis pathway, O antigens are assembled on the cytosolic side of the inner membrane on a lipid anchor and reoriented to the periplasmic leaflet by WzmWzt for ligation to the core lipopolysaccharides. This process depends on the chemical modification of the O antigen's nonreducing terminus, sensed by WzmWzt via a carbohydrate-binding domain (CBD) that extends its nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). Caffalette and Zimmer 2021 provided the cryoEM structure of this full-length WzmWzt transporter bound to ATP in a lipid environment, revealing a highly asymmetric transporter organization. The CBDs dimerize and associate with only one NBD. Conserved loops at the CBD dimer interface straddle a conserved peripheral NBD helix. The CBD dimer is oriented perpendicularly to the NBDs and its putative ligand-binding sites face the transporter to likely modulate ATPase activity upon O antigen binding. A closed WzmWzt conformation in which an aromatic belt near the periplasmic channel exit seals the transporter in a resting, ATP-bound state.

MsbA also confers drug resistance to azidopine, daunomycin, vinblastine, Hoechst 33342 and ethidium (Reuter et al., 2003). Four x-ray structures, trapped in different conformations, two with and two without nucleotide, have been solved (Ward et al., 2007). They suggest an alternating accessibility mode of transport with major conformational changes.  The mechanism and conformational transitions have been discussed (Moradi and Tajkhorshid 2013).  MsbA is energized both by ATP hydrolysis and the H+ electrochemical gradient (Singh et al. 2016). Mi et al. 2017 used single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to elucidate the structures of lipid-nanodisc-embedded MsbA in three functional states. The 4.2 Å-resolution structure of the transmembrane domains of nucleotide-free MsbA revealed that LPS binds deeply inside MsbA at the height of the periplasmic leaflet. Two sub-nanometre-resolution structures of MsbA with ADP-vanadate and ADP revealed a closed and an inward-facing conformation, respectively. A  2.9 A resolution structure of MsbA in complex with G907, a selective small-molecule antagonist with bactericidal activity, revealed an unanticipated mechanism of ABC transporter inhibition. G907 traps MsbA in an inward-facing, lipopolysaccharide-bound conformation by wedging into an architecturally conserved transmembrane pocket. A second allosteric mechanism of antagonism occurs through structural and functional uncoupling of the nucleotide-binding domains (Ho et al. 2018). Coupled ATPase-adenylate kinase activity in ABC transporters including MsbA has been demonstrated (Kaur et al. 2016). Close-proximity effects and structural coupling of the transmembrane domains with the NBDs has been suggested (Josts et al. 2019). Two first-generation inhibitors of MsbA, TBT1 and G247, induce opposite effects on ATP hydrolysis. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and functional assays, TBT1 and G247 were found to bind adjacent yet separate pockets in the MsbA transmembrane domains (Thélot et al. 2021). MsbA adopts the wide inward-open conformation in E. coli cells (Galazzo et al. 2022).  Solid-state NMR spectroscopy rvealed that substantial chemical shift changes within both CH1 and CH2 occur upon substrate binding, in the ATP hydrolysis transition state, and upon inhibitor binding. CH2 is domain-swapped within the MsbA structure, and substrate binding induces a larger response in CH2 compared to CH1. These data show that CH1 and CH2 undergo structural changes as part of the TMD-NBD cross-talk (Novischi et al. 2024).",{'secretion'},abc,-,-->,"{'8150': 'phospholipid', '25051': 'lipid As', '6494': 'lipopolysaccharide', '23888': 'drug'}","{'8150': set(), '25051': set(), '6494': set(), '23888': set()}",R_3_A_1_106_1,"{'8150': set(), '25051': set(), '6494': set(), '23888': set()}"

It activates the sensor kinase, KinA, during sporulation initiation (Fukushima et al. 2006). Large scale purification has been achieved (Galián et al. 2011).  It has been reconstituted in giant unilamellar vesicles (Dezi et al. 2013).  It exhibits an asymmetric
configuration of catalytically inequivalent nucleotide binding sites. The two-state transition of
the TMS domains, from an inward- to an outward-facing conformation, may be driven exclusively by ATP hydrolysis (Mishra et al. 2014). A novel intermediate of BmrCD, a heterodimeric multidrug ABC exporter from Bacillus subtilis. has been identified (Thaker et al. 2021). In the cryo-EM structure, ATP-bound BmrCD adopts an inward-facing architecture featuring two molecules of the substrate Hoechst-33342 in an asymmetric head-to-tail arrangement. Deletion of the extracellular domain capping the substrate-binding chamber or mutation of Hoechst-coordinating residues abrogates cooperative stimulation of ATP hydrolysis. These findings support a mechanistic role for symmetry mismatch between the nucleotide binding and the transmembrane domains in the conformational cycle of ABC transporters (Thaker et al. 2021).

TmrA (Q72J05; 600 aas with 6 N-terminal TMSs) and TmrB (Q72J04; 578 aas with 6 N-terminal TMSs) comprise this heterodimeric transporter, both proteins of the M-C structure.  The system has been found to export the dye, hoechst 33342, and to be inhibited by verapamil (Zutz et al. 2011). The subnanometre-resolution structure of detergent-solubilized TmrAB in a nucleotide-free, inward-facing conformation by single-particle 
electron cryomicroscopy has been solved (Kim et al. 2015). A cavity in the 
transmembrane domain is accessible laterally from the cytoplasmic side 
of the membrane as well as from the cytoplasm, indicating that the 
transporter lies in an inward-facing open conformation. The two 
nucleotide-binding domains remain in contact via their carboxy-terminal 
helices. Comparison between this structure and those of other ABC transporters suggests a possible trajectory of 
conformational changes that involves a sliding and rotating motion 
between the two nucleotide-binding domains during the transition from 
the inward-facing to outward-facing conformations (Kim et al. 2015). A subset of annular lipids is normally invariant in composition, with negatively charged lipids binding tightly to TmrAB, suggesting that this exporter may be involved in glycolipid translocation (Bechara et al. 2015). Coupled ATPase-adenylate kinase activity in ABC transporters including TmrAB has been demonstrated (Kaur et al. 2016). A 2.7-Å X-ray structure of TmrAB has been determined. It not only shares structural homology with the antigen 
translocation complex TAP, but is also able to restore antigen 
processing in human TAP-deficient cells. TmrAB exhibits a broad peptide specificity and can concentrate substrates 
several thousandfold, using only one single active ATP-binding site. It
 adopts an asymmetric inward-facing state, and the 
C-terminal helices, arranged in a zipper-like fashion, play a 
role in guiding the conformational changes associated with substrate 
transport (Nöll et al. 2017). Conformational coupling and trans-inhibition have been characterized (Barth et al. 2018), and a  conserved motif in intracellular loop 1 stabilizes the outward-facing conformation of TmrAB (Millan et al. 2021). A strong entropy-enthalpy compensation mechanism enables the closure of the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) over a wide temperature range. This is mechanically coupled with an outward opening of the transmembrane domains (TMDs) accompanied by an entropy gain (Barth et al. 2020).  TmrAB undergoes a reversible transition in the presence of ATP with a significantly faster forward transition. The impaired degenerate NBS stably binds Mn2+-ATP, and Mn2+ is preferentially released at the active consensus NBS (Rudolf et al. 2023). ATP hydrolysis at the consensus NBS considerably accelerates the reverse transition. Both NBSs fully open during each conformational cycle, and the degenerate NBS may regulate the kinetics of this process (Rudolf et al. 2023).",{'secretion'},abc,-,-->,"{'5742': ""2'-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-2,5'-bibenzimidazole""}",{'5742': set()},R_3_A_1_106_18,{'5742': set()}

CcmC (9.B.14.2.3) is required for the transfer of heme to CcmE in the periplasm (Richard-Fogal et al., 2008) In the presence of heme, CcmC and CcmE form a stable complex (Richard-Fogal & Kranz, 2010) as do CcmE and CcmF (San Francisco and Kranz 2014). The cytochrome c maturation system I, consisting of eight membrane/periplasmic
proteins (CcmABCDEFGH), results in the attachment of heme to cysteine 
residues of cytochrome c proteins. Since all c-type cytochromes are 
periplasmic, heme is first transported to a periplasmic heme chaperone, 
CcmE. A large membrane complex, CcmABCD has been proposed to carry out 
this transport and linkage to CcmE. Li et al. 2022 described high 
resolution cryo-EM structures of CcmABCD in an unbound form, in complex 
with inhibitor AMP-PNP, and in complex with ATP and heme. The 
ATP-binding site in CcmA and the heme-binding site in CcmC were identified. They proposed a
model of heme trafficking, heme transfer to CcmE, and ATP-dependent 
release of holoCcmE from CcmABCD. CcmABCD represents an ABC transporter 
complex using the energy of ATP hydrolysis for the transfer of heme from
 one binding partner (CcmC, see TC# 9.B.14.2.3) to another (CcmE) (Li et al. 2022). It appers that CcmC is in a complex with CcmABD but is not part of the ABC transporter.

The pathway for peptide export consists of an large α-helical barrel for small folded peptides.  ATP binding alternates access to the transmembrane pathway and reglates protease activity (Lin et al. 2015). Subunit asymmetry of the M3-M4 loops contribute to optimizing AChR activation through allosteric links to the channel and the agonist binding site (Shen et al. 2005). Structures were more recently determined in the absence and presence of ATP, revealing how ATP binding regulates the protease activity and access to the translocation pathway. Two substrate CtAs, 90-residue polypeptides, are bound via their N-terminal leader peptides, but only one is positioned for cleavage and translocation. The structures were determined in the absence and presence of ATP, revealing how ATP binding regulates the protease activity and access to the translocation pathway. It seems that substrate cleavage, ATP hydrolysis, and substrate translocation are coordinated in a transport cycle (Kieuvongngam et al. 2020). The N-terminal C39 peptidase (PEP) domain of PCAT1 processes its natural substrate, CtA, by cleaving a conserved -GG- motif to separate the cargo from the leader peptide prior to secretion. The ATP-mediated association between PEP and the transmembrane domains of PCAT1 offers a putative mechanism to optimize peptide cleavage by regulating the width and flexibility of the enzyme active site (Bhattacharya and Palillo 2021).

Both MacA and MacB are required for activity (Tikhonova et al., 2007). MacAB functions with TolC to export multiple drugs and heat-stable enterotoxin II (enterotoxin STII) (Yamanaka et al., 2008).  The crystal structure of MacA is available (Yum et al., 2009). MacB is a dimer whose ATPase activity and macrolide-binding capacity are regulated by the membrane fusion protein MacA (Lin et al., 2009). Xu et al. (2009) have reported the crystal structure of the periplasmic region of MacB which they claim resembles the periplasmic domain of RND-type transporters such as AcrB (TC# 2.A.6.2.2). Also exports L-cysteine (Yamada et al., 2006). The periplasmic membrane proximal domain of MacA acts as a switch in stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by the MacB transporter (Modali and Zgurskaya, 2011). Fitzpatrick et al. 2017 presented an electron cryo-microscopy structure of the tripartite assembly (MacAB-TolC) at near-atomic resolution. A hexamer of the periplasmic protein MacA bridges a TolC trimer in the outer membrane to a MacB dimer in the inner membrane, generating a quaternary structure with a central channel for substrate translocation. A gating ring found in MacA may act as a one-way valve in substrate transport. The MacB structure features an atypical transmembrane domain with a closely packed dimer interface and a periplasmic opening that is the likely portal for substrate entry from the periplasm, with subsequent displacement through an allosteric transport mechanism (Fitzpatrick et al. 2017). The structure of ATP-bound MacB has been solved, revealing precise molecular details of its mechanism (Crow et al. 2017). MacB has a fold that is different from other structurally characterized ABC transporters and uses a unique molecular mechanism termed mechanotransmission. Unlike other bacterial ABC transporters, MacB does not transport substrates across the inner membrane in which it is based, but instead couples cytoplasmic ATP hydrolysis with transmembrane conformational changes that are used to perform work in the extra-cytoplasmic space. In the MacAB-TolC tripartite pump, mechanotransmission drives efflux of antibiotics and export of a protein toxin from the periplasmic space via the TolC exit duct. Homologous tripartite systems from pathogenic bacteria similarly export protein-like signaling molecules, virulence factors and siderophores (Greene et al. 2018).",{'secretion'},abc,-,-->,"{'6207': 'L-cysteine', '25106': 'macrolide', '4841': 'erythromycin A', '23888': 'drug'}","{'6207': {'cys__L'}, '25106': set(), '4841': set(), '23888': set()}",R_3_A_1_122_1,"{'6207': {'atp_c + h2o_c + cys__L_c --> cys__L_e + pi_c + h_c + adp_c'}, '25106': set(), '4841': set(), '23888': set()}"

enterotoxin STII out of the bacterial cell. Crow et al. 2017 presented the 
structure of ATP-bound MacB and reveal precise molecular details of its 
mechanism. The MacB transmembrane domain lacks a central cavity through 
which substrates could be passed, but instead conveys conformational 
changes from one side of the membrane to the other, a process termed mechanotransmission. Comparison of 
ATP-bound and nucleotide-free states revealed how reversible dimerization
 of the nucleotide binding domains drives opening and closing of the 
MacB periplasmic domains via concerted movements of the second 
transmembrane segment and the major coupling helix. They proposed that the 
assembled tripartite pump acts as a molecular bellows to propel 
substrates through the TolC exit duct, driven by MacB 
mechanotransmission. Homologs of MacB that do not form tripartite pumps,
 but share structural features underpinning mechanotransmission, include
 the LolCDE lipoprotein trafficking complex and FtsEX cell division 
signaling protein. The MacB architecture serves as a blueprint for

The structure of ligand-bound LolCDE has been solved (Ito et al., 2006). LolC and LolE each have 4 TMSs (1+3). Unlike most ATP binding cassette transporters mediating the transmembrane flux of substrates, the LolCDE complex catalyzes the extrusion of lipoproteins anchored to the outer leaflet of the inner membrane. The LolCDE complex is unusual in that it can be purified as a liganded form, which is an intermediate of the lipoprotein release reaction (Taniguchi and Tokuda, 2008). LolCDE has been reconstituted from separated subunits (Kanamaru et al., 2007).  LolE binds the outer membrane lipoprotein, PAL (Mizutani et al. 2013). The mechanism of LolCDE as a molecular extruder of bacterial triacylated lipoproteins has been reported (Sharma et al. 2021) who determined the cryo-EM structures of nanodisc-embedded LolCDE in the nucleotide-free and nucleotide-bound states at 3.8-Å and 3.5-Å resolution, respectively. The structural analyses, together with biochemical and mutagenesis studies, uncovered how LolCDE recognizes its substrate by interacting with the lipid and N-terminal peptide moieties of the lipoprotein, and identify the amide-linked acyl chain as the key element for LolCDE interaction. Upon nucleotide binding, the transmembrane helices and the periplasmic domains of LolCDE undergo large-scale, asymmetric movements, resulting in extrusion of the captured lipoprotein. Comparison of LolCDE and MacB revealed the conserved mechanism of type VII ABC transporters and emphasized the unique properties of LolCDE as a molecule extruder of triacylated lipoproteins (Sharma et al. 2021).",{'uptake'},abc,-,-->,{'6495': 'lipoprotein'},{'6495': {'lpp'}},R_3_A_1_125_1,{'6495': {'atp_c + h2o_c + lpp_e --> lpp_c + pi_c + h_c + adp_c'}}

This system is also listed in TCDB under TC#1.B.42.1.2 as part of a multicomponent system.  The entire system is described in detail there. LptB2FG extracts LPSs from the IM and transports them to the outer membrane. Luo et al. 2017 reported the crystal structure of nucleotide-free LptB2FG from P. aeruginosa.
 It shows that LPS transport proteins LptF and LptG each contain a TM 
domain (TMD), a periplasmic beta-jellyroll-like domain and a coupling 
helix that interacts with LptB on the cytoplasmic side. The LptF and 
LptG TMDs form a large outward-facing V-shaped cavity in the IM. 
Mutational analyses suggested that LPS may enter the central cavity 
laterally, via the interface of the TMD domains of LptF and LptG, and is
 expelled into the beta-jellyroll-like domains upon ATP binding and 
hydrolysis by LptB. These studies suggest a mechanism for LPS extraction
 by LptB2FG that is distinct from those of classical ABC transporters that transport substrates across the IM (Luo et al. 2017). LptB2FG extracts LPS from the periplasmic face of the IM through a pair of lateral gates and then powers transperiplasmic transport to the OM through a slide formed by either of the periplasmic domains of LptF or LptG, LptC, LptA and the N-terminal domain of LptD. The structural and functional studies of the seven lipopolysaccharide transport proteins provide a platform to explore the unusual mechanisms of LPS extraction, transport and insertion from the inner membrane to the outer membrane (Dong et al. 2017).

The 134-kDa protein complex is unique among ABC transporters because it extracts lipopolysaccharide from the external leaflet of the inner membrane and propels it along a filament that extends across the periplasm to directly deliver lipopolysaccharide into the external leaflet of the outer membrane. Dong et al. 2017 reported the crystal structure of this transporter in which both LptF and LptG are composed of a beta-jellyroll-like periplasmic domain and six TMSs. LptF and LptG together form a central cavity containing highly conserved hydrophobic residues. Structural and functional studies suggest that LptB2FG uses an alternating lateral access mechanism to extract lipopolysaccharide and traffic it along the hydrophobic cavity toward the transporter's periplasmic domains. The structure has been presented by Dong et al. 2017. LPS transport involves long-ranging bi- directional coupling across cellular compartments between cytoplasmic LptB and periplasmic regions of the Lpt transporter (Lundstedt et al. 2020). LPS transport from the inner membrane (IM) to the OM is achieved by seven lipopolysaccharide transport proteins (LptA-G). LptB2FG, a type VI ABC transporter, forms a stable complex with LptC, extracts LPS from the IM and powers LPS transport to the OM. Luo et al. 2021 reported the cryo-EM structures of LptB2FG and LptB2FGC from Klebsiella pneumoniae in complex with LPS. The LptB2FG-LPS structure provides detailed interactions between LPS and the transporter, while the LptB2FGC-LPS structure may represent an intermediate state in which the transmembrane helix of LptC has not been fully inserted into the transmembrane domains of LptB2FG (Luo et al. 2021).",{'secretion'},abc,-,-->,{},{},R_3_A_1_152_9,{}

Expression is induced early in the stationary phase. The six ytr  genes form a single operon, transcribed from a promoter present upstream of ytrA. YtrA, which 
possesses a helix-turn-helix motif of the GntR family, may be a
 repressor that regulates its own transcription as well as the whole operon. Inactivation of the 
operon led to a decrease in the maximal cell yield and less-efficient 
sporulation. B. subtilis produces acetoin as 
an external carbon storage compound and then reuses it later during 
stationary phase and sporulation. Possibly the Ytr porter plays a role (Yoshida et al. 2000). The YtrEF system, believed to be a distinct ABC efflux system (M. Saier, unpublished results), can be found under TC# 3.A.1.122.19.",{'uptake'},abc,-,-->,{},{},R_3_A_1_153_1,{}

Kinking of TMS 6 in the post-ATP hydrolysis state, stabilized by MgADPVO4, eliminates this cavity, precluding uptake of glutathione derivatives.

interact in a single structural domain which then functions in gating H+ release to the
cytoplasm (Steed et al. 2014). Three different states that relate to rotation of the enzyme have been observed, with the central stalk's epsilon subunit in an extended autoinhibitory conformation in all three states (Sobti et al. 2016). The Fo motor consists of seven transmembrane helices and a decameric c-ring, and invaginations on either side of the membrane indicate the entry and exit channels for protons. The proton translocating subunit contains near parallel helices inclined by ~30 degrees to the membrane, a feature corresponding to rotary ATPases. This rotary ATPase subtype, the peripheral stalk, is resolved over the entire length of the complex, revealing the F1 attachment points and a coiled-coil that bifurcates toward the membrane with its helices separating to embrace subunit a from two sides (Sobti et al. 2016).

5858,3.A.2.2.2,Bacteria,Bacillota,Na+-translocating V-type ATPase,"Na+-translocating V-type ATPase. The V-ATPase of E. hirae (EhV-ATPase) is composed of a soluble catalytic domain (V1; NtpA3-B3-D-G) and an integral membrane domain (V0; NtpI-K10) connected by a central and two peripheral stalks (NtpC, NtpD-G and NtpE-F) (see schematic figure 1 on pg. 60 of Muhammed et al., 2012). The membrane rotor ring of the Na+-ATPase consists of 10 NtpK subunits, which are homologs of the 16-KDa and 8-KDa proteolipids found in other V-ATPases and F-ATPases. Each NtpK subunit has four transmembrane alpha helices, with a sodium ion bound between helices 2 and 4 at a site buried deeply in the membrane that includes the essential residue glutamate-139 (Murata et al. 2005). This site is probably connected to the membrane surface by two half-channels in subunit NtpI, against which the ring rotates. Symmetry mismatch between the rotor and catalytic domains appears to be an intrinsic feature of both V- and F-ATPases (Murata et al. 2005). The EhV-ATPase is a Na+ pump in. Tsunoda et al. 2018 presented the entire structure of detergent-solubilized EhV-ATPase by single-particle cryo-EM using Zernike phase plates. The cryo-EM map showed one of three catalytic conformations. To further stabilize the originally heterogeneous structure caused by ATP hydrolysis, a peptide epitope tag system interfered with rotation of the central rotor by binding the Fab. As a result, the map unexpectedly showed another catalytic conformation of EhV-ATPase. These two conformations with and without Fab conversely coincided with those of the minor state 2 and the major state 1 of Thermus thermophilus V/A-ATPase, respectively. The most prominent feature in EhV-ATPase was the off-axis rotor, where the cytoplasmic V1 domain was connected to the Vo domain through the off-axis central rotor. Compared to the structure of ATP synthases, the larger size of the interface between the transmembrane a-subunit and c-ring of EhV-ATPase would be more advantageous for active ion pumping (Tsunoda et al. 2018).",{'uptake'},,,,{'9175': 'sodium(1+)'},{'9175': {'na1'}},R_3_A_2_2_2,{'9175': set()}

related prokaryotic copper resistance systems and is involved in copper transfer to the
membrane-integral ion binding sites of CopA. In contrast, the proximal domain MBD2 has a regulatory
role by suppressing the catalytic activity of CopA in the absence of copper (Drees et al. 2015). The functions of Me2+ exporters are often supported by chaperone proteins, which scavenge the metal ions from the cytoplasm. A CopA chaperone is expressed in E. coli from the same gene that encodes the transporter (Meydan et al. 2017). Some ribosomes translating copA undergo programmed frameshifting, terminate translation in the -1 frame, and generate the 70 aa-long polypeptide CopA(Z), which helps cells survive toxic copper concentrations. The high efficiency of frameshifting is achieved by the combined stimulatory action of a ""slippery"" sequence, an mRNA pseudoknot, and the CopA nascent chain. Similar mRNA elements are not only found in the copA genes of other bacteria but are also present in ATP7B, the human homolog of copA, and direct ribosomal frameshifting in vivo (Meydan et al. 2017). Cu(i) (Cu+) pumps, of which CopA is an example, are primary-active electrogenic uniporters. The Cu+ translocation cycle does not require proton counter-transport, resulting in electrogenic generation of a transmembrane potential upon translocation of one Cu+ per ATP hydrolysis in the catalytic cycle (Abeyrathna et al. 2020).",{'secretion'},,,,"{'49551': 'copper(1+)', '49468': 'silver(1+)'}","{'49551': {'cu'}, '49468': {'ag'}}",R_3_A_3_5_5,"{'49551': set(), '49468': set()}"

The copper-transporting P1B-ATPases have been divided traditionally into two subfamilies, the P1B-1-ATPases or CopAs and the P1B-3-ATPases or CopBs. CopAs selectively export Cu+ whereas previous studies have suggested that CopBs are specific for Cu2+ export. Biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of Sphaerobacter thermophilus CopB (StCopB) showed that, while it does bind Cu2+, the binding site is not in the transmembrane domain (Purohit et al. 2018).  StCopB exhibits metal-stimulated ATPase activity in response to Cu+, but not Cu2+, indicating that it is actually a Cu+ transporter. Cu+ is coordinated by four sulfur ligands derived from conserved cysteine and methionine residues. The histidine-rich N-terminal region is required for maximal activity, but is inhibitory in the presence of divalent metal ions. P1B-1- and P1B-3-ATPases may therefore all transport Cu+ (Purohit et al. 2018).",{'secretion'},,,,{'23379': 'copper(1+)'},{'23379': {'cu'}},R_3_A_3_5_38,{'23379': set()}

The KdpFABC acts as a functional and structural dimer with the two KdpB subunits in direct contact, but the enzyme can dissociate to the monomer (Heitkamp et al., 2008).  KdpF is part of and stabilizes the KdpABC complex (Gassel et al., 1999).  Transcription of the kdp operon is activated by the KdpDE sensor kinase/response regulator pair, and unphosphorylated IIANtr of the PTS (TC# 4.A) binds KdpD to stimulate its activity, thereby enhancing kdp operon expression (Lüttmann et al. 2009, Lüttmann et al. 2015). Transcriptional regulation of the Pseudomonas putida kdpFABC operon by the KdpDE sensor kinase/response regulator by direct interaction of IIANtr of the PTS with KdpD has also been studied (Wolf et al. 2015). The 2.9 Å X-ray structure of the complete Escherichia coli KdpFABC complex with a potassium ion within the selectivity filter of KdpA and a water molecule at a canonical cation site in the transmembrane domain of KdpB has been solved (Huang et al. 2017). The structure reveals two structural elements that appear to mediate the coupling between these two subunits: a protein-embedded tunnel runs between these potassium and water sites, and a helix controlling the cytoplasmic gate of KdpA is linked to the phosphorylation domain of KdpB. A mechanism that repurposes protein channel architecture for active transport across biomembranes was proposed (Huang et al. 2017). The cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of KdpD functions as a K+ sensor (Rothenbücher et al. 2006). Serine phosphorylated KdpB is trapped in a conformation where the ion-binding site is hydrated via an intracellular pathway between TMSs M1 and M2 which opens in response to the rearrangement of cytoplasmic domains, resulting from phosphorylation (Dubey et al. 2021). This causes pump inhibition in the presence of high K+ resulting in ATP conservation.",{'uptake'},,,,{'8345': 'potassium(1+)'},{'8345': {'k'}},R_3_A_3_7_1,{'8345': set()}

A kdpA null mutantion reduced the fraction of persisters after exposure to rifampicin (Liu et al. 2020). kdpA encodes a transmembrane protein that is part of the Kdp-ATPase, an ATP-dependent high-affinity potassium (K+) transport system. kdpA expression is induced under low K+ conditions and is required for pH homeostasis and growth in media with low concentrations of K+. Inactivation of the Kdp system caused hyperpolarization of the membrane potential, increased the proton motive force (PMF) and elevated levels of intracellular ATP. The KdpA mutant phenotype could be complemented with a functional kdpA gene or supplementation with high K+ concentrations. Thus, the Kdp system is required for ATP homeostasis and persister formation. ATP-mediated regulation of persister formation may be a general mechanism in bacteria, and suggest that K+ transporters may play a role in the regulation of ATP levels and persistence (Liu et al. 2020).",{'uptake'},,,,{'8345': 'potassium(1+)'},{'8345': {'k'}},R_3_A_3_7_3,{'8345': set()}

Docking of a phosphatidylcholine headgroup in silico showed that the cavity can accommodate a phospholipid headgroup, likely leaving the fatty acid tails in contact with the hydrophobic portion of the lipid bilayer. Mutagenesis data supported this interpretation and suggested that two residues in TMS 4 (Y374 and F375) are important for coordination of the phospholipid headgroup (Jensen et al. 2017).

However, there may be additional TMSs. It is a high affinity, slow turnover, heavy metal transporting ATPase CtpC 
(Rv3270), which is required for virulence. It controls 
the Mn2+ cytoplasmic quota and is involved in the uploading of Mn2+ into secreted metalloproteins (Padilla-Benavides et al. 2013). It shows a preference for Mn2+, but Zn2+, Co2+ and Cu2+ can act as alternative substrates although at slower turnover rates (Padilla-Benavides et al. 2013). It mediates resistance to zinc poisoning. Boudehen et al. 2022 showed that zinc resistance also depends on a chaperone-like protein, PacL1 (Rv3269; TC# 8.A.201.1.1). PacL1 contains an N-terminal TMS, a cytoplasmic region with glutamine/alanine repeats and a C-terminal metal-binding motif (MBM). PacL1 binds Zn2+, but the MBM is required only at high zinc concentrations. PacL1 co-localizes with CtpC in dynamic foci in the mycobacterial plasma membrane, and the two proteins form high molecular weight complexes. Foci formation does not require flotillin or the PacL1 MBM. However, deletion of the PacL1 Glu/Ala repeats leads to loss of CtpC and sensitivity to zinc. Genes pacL1 and ctpC appear to be in the same operon, and homologous gene pairs are found in the genomes of other bacteria. PacL1 colocalizes and functions redundantly with other PacL orthologs in M. tuberculosis. Thus, PacL proteins may act as scaffolds that assemble P-ATPase-containing metal efflux platforms mediating bacterial resistance to metal poisoning (Boudehen et al. 2022).",{'uptake'},,,,"{'23337': 'cobalt(2+)', '23380': 'copper(2+)', '29035': 'manganese(2+)', '10113': 'zinc(2+)', '25213': 'metal cation'}","{'23337': {'cobalt2'}, '23380': {'cu2'}, '29035': {'mn2'}, '10113': {'zn2', 'HC02172'}, '25213': set()}",R_3_A_3_32_2,"{'23337': set(), '23380': set(), '29035': set(), '10113': set(), '25213': set()}"

A biphasic pulling force may act on TMSs during translocon-mediated membrane integration (Ismail et al. 2012).  Intermediate structures for the insertion of integral membrane proteins have been visualized (Bischoff et al. 2014).  Insertion of the Type II single span (N-terminus, in, C-terminus, out) protein, RodZ, requires only SecYEG, SecA and the pmf, but not SecB, SecDF, YidC or FtsY (Rawat et al. 2015).  The combined effects of
ribosome and peptide binding to SecYEG may allow for co-translational membrane insertion of successive
transmembrane segments (Ge et al. 2014). SecA penetrates deeply into the SecYEG channel during insertion, contacting transmembrane helices and periplasmic loops (Banerjee et al. 2017). A partially inserted nascent chain unzips the Sec translocon's lateral gate (Kater et al. 2019). Cardiolipin (CL) is required in vivo for the stability of the bacterial translocon (SecYEG) as well as
 its efficient function in co-translational insertion into and 
translocation across the inner membrane of E. coli (Ryabichko et al. 2020). PpiD (623 aas and 1 N-terminal TMS), a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase D, and YfgM (206 aas and 1 N-terminal TMS) facilitate the transport of toxins into the E. coli cell in a SecY-dependent process (Jones et al. 2021). Synchronized real-time measurement of Sec-mediated protein translocation has been described (Gupta et al. 2021). An extracellular cutinase from Amycolatopsis mediterranei (AmCut) is able to degrade the plastics, polycaprolactone and polybutylene succinate (Tan et al. 2022). It is secreted from E. coli using the Sec system for export across the inner membrane, and possibly, a non-classical secretion pathway for export across the outer membrane (Tan et al. 2022). The inner membrane YfgM-PpiD heterodimer, both proteins with N-terminal transmembrane segments and C-terminal periplasmic domains, acts as a functional unit that associates with the SecY/E/G translocon and promotes protein translocation (Miyazaki et al. 2022).

The ortholog of SpaQ in E. coli (SctS, of 86 aas and 2 TMSs like SpaQ) functions to ensures the fittings between the dynamic and static components of the T3SS (Tseytin et al. 2019). The Salmonella flagellar protein export machinery consists of a transmembrane export gate complex and a cytoplasmic ATPase complex. The gate complex has two intrinsic and distinct H+-driven and Na+-driven engines to drive the export of flagellar structural proteins (Minamino et al. 2021). Salmonella wild-type cells preferentially use the H+-driven engine under a variety of environmental conditions. The Na+-driven engine is activated by the interaction of the FlgN chaperone with FlhA when the ATPase complex is non-functional due to either of two single-residue substitutions in FlhA. Thus, it is likely that the FlgN-FlhA interaction generates a conformational change in FlhA that allows it to function as a Na+ channel. Minamino et al. 2021 proposed that this type of activation would be useful for flagellar construction under conditions in which the proton motive force is severely restricted. In enteropathogenic E. coli, assembly of the T3SS is initiated by the association of three proteins, SctR, SctS, and SctT, which create an entry portal to the translocation channel within the bacterial inner membrane. Using the T3SS, Tseytin et al. 2022 investigated the role of two structural construction sites formed within the SctRST complex that are likely to act as seals, preventing leakage of ions and metabolites rather than as substrate gates. Two residues in SctS, Pro23, and Lys54, are critical for the proper activity of the T3SS. Pro23 may be critical for the physical orientation of the SctS transmembrane domains that create the tip of the SctRST complex and for their positioning with regard to other T3SS substructures. SctS Lys54, which was previously suggested to mediate the SctS self-oligomerization, is critical for T3SS activity due to its essential role in SctS-SctT hetero-interactions (Tseytin et al. 2022). SctR: 217 aas and 4 TMSs, 2 N-terminal and 2 C-terminal; SctS: 86 aas and 2 TMSs; SctT: 255 aas and 6 TMSs in a 3 + 1 + 2 TMS arrangement.",{'secretion'},,,,{'8526': 'protein polypeptide chain'},{'8526': set()},R_3_A_6_1_3,{'8526': set()}

Immunofluorescence microscopy deciphered an early-stage assembly process that begins with the targeting of Dot/Icm components to the bacterial poles. Polar targeting of this T4BSS is mediated by two Dot/Icm proteins, DotU and IcmF, that are homologues of the T6SS membrane complex components TssL and TssM, suggesting that the Dot/Icm T4BSS is a hybrid system.

EssC is an integral component of the bacterial """"Type VII"""" secretion system
(T7SS). The protein is
predicted to consist of an intracellular repeat of forkhead-associated (FHA) domains at the
N-terminus, two transmembrane helices and three P-loop containing ATPase-type domains, D1-3, forming
the C-terminal intracellular segment. Zoltner et al. 2016 presented crystal structures of the N-terminal FHA domains
(EssC-N) and a C-terminal fragment EssC-C from Geobacillus thermodenitrificans,
encompassing two of the ATPase-type modules, D2 and D3. Module D2 binds ATP with high affinity
whereas D3 does not. The EssC-N and EssC-C constructs are monomeric in solution but the full-length
recombinant protein, with molecular weight about 169 kDa, forms a multimer of approximately 1 MDa.
The observation of protomer contacts in the crystal structure of EssC-C together with similarity to
the DNA translocase FtsK, suggests a model for a hexameric EssC assembly. Such an observation
potentially identifies the key component of pore formation required for
secretion. The extreme C-terminal ATPase domain appears essential
for EssC activity as a key part of the T7SS whilst D2 and FHA domains are required for the
production of a stable and functional protein (Zoltner et al. 2016). TheTMSs of EssA and EssB interact, regulating secretion (Ahmed et al. 2018).

Myxococcus xanthus, a soil bacterium, predates collectively using
 motility to invade prey colonies. Prey lysis is mostly thought to rely 
on secreted factors, cocktails of antibiotics and enzymes as well as direct 
contact with Myxococcus cells. Seef et al. 2021 showed that on 
surfaces, the coupling of A-motility and contact-dependent killing is the
 central predatory mechanism driving effective prey colony invasion and 
consumption. At the molecular level, contact-dependent killing involves a type IV filament-like machinery (Kil) that both 
promotes motility arrest and prey cell plasmolysis. In this process, Kil
 proteins assemble at the predator-prey contact site, suggesting that 
they allow tight contact with prey cells for their intoxication. 
Kil-like systems form a new class of Tad-like machineries in predatory 
bacteria, suggesting a conserved function in predator-prey interactions.

6037,3.A.23.6.1,Bacteria,Bacteroidota,"To interact with other cells, bacteria use contractile machines that 
function similarly to membrane-puncturing bacteriophages","To interact with other cells, bacteria use contractile machines that 
function similarly to membrane-puncturing bacteriophages. The so-called 
type 6 secretion system (T6SS) functions from inside a bacterial cell. 
Böck et al. used modern electron microscopy methods and 
functional assays to resolve the structure and function of a T6SS in the
 cellular context. They identified three modules and showed large-scale 
structural changes upon firing. T6SSs are organized in multibarrel 
gun-like arrays and may contribute to the survival of bacteria inside 
their host. 
Contractile
 injection systems (CISs) deliver effectors to mediate bacterial 
cell-cell interactions. Their structural components are homologous to 
the contractile tails of phages (1).
 CISs consist of an inner tube surrounded by a contractile sheath, a 
spike capping the inner tube, and a baseplate complex at the base of the
 sheath. Sheath contraction propels the inner tube into the target. Two 
modes of action divide CISs into “extracellular CISs” (eCISs) and “type 6
 secretion” (T6S) systems (T6SSs). eCISs resemble headless phages; they 
are released into the medium and bind to the target cell surface. 
Examples are antibacterial R-type bacteriocins (Leiman and Shneider 2012), insecticidal antifeeding prophages (Afps) (Hurst et al. 2004), and metamorphosis-inducing structures (MACs) (Shikuma et al. 2014). By contrast, the T6SS is defined by its cytoplasmic localization and anchoring to the inner membrane (Basler et al. 2012; Hachani et al. 2016); Chang et al. 2017).
Amoebophilus asiaticus is an obligate intracellular bacterial symbiont of amoebae. The Amoebophilus genome does not encode known secretion systems, but it contains a gene cluster with similarities to that of Afps. Böck et al. 2017 reasoned that the Afp-like gene cluster might encode a system that 
would give insight into T6SS structure, function, and evolution.
Thus, the Amoebophilus Afp-like gene cluster encodes a T6SS (Böck et al. 2017). Sequence analyses 
indicated a close relationship to eCISs, and the term
 “T6SS subtype 4” (T6SSiv) was therefore introduced. In contrast to the distant relationships of T6SSi-iii to eCISs and phages that obstruct the reconstruction of an evolutionary path (1, 24), it can be hypothesized that T6SSiv evolved from an Afp/MAC-like eCIS (independently of T6SSi-iii)
 by the loss of tail fibers, loss of holin, and the establishment of 
interactions with the cytoplasmic membrane. Alternatively, T6SSiv represents a primordial system from which eCISs, phages, and T6SSi-iii evolved. T6SSiv-like
 gene clusters were detected in six diverse bacterial phyla. 
The finding that diverse T6SS subtypes do not share a conserved gene set
 that would distinguish them from eCISs or phages emphasizes the 
necessity of an integrative approach to discover and characterize new 
systems. This situation is reminiscent of type IV secretion systems (3.A.7).",{'uptake'},,,,{},{},R_3_A_23_6_1,{}

EccA1 may be a secreted protein while ECCB1 - E1 may comprise the system (Houben et al. 2012).  This system (ESX-1) is present in the avirulent species, Mycobacterium smegmatis, where it is involved in conjugation (Coros et al. 2008).  ESX-1 uses the ESX-1-specific chaparone protein, EspG to interact with the secreted PE/PPE complex, while a homologous EspG specific for ESX-5 functions with the PE/PPE complex secreted by ESX-5.  Thus, EspG proteins may be system-specific chaparones for T7SSs (Daleke et al. 2012).  The main secreted virulence protein complex is a heterodimer: EsxA(ESAT-6)/EsxB(CFP-10) (Rosenberger et al. 2012). EccB, a periplasmic homoheximer with the ATP-binding active site shared by two adjacent subunits, may
act as the energy provider in the transport of T7SS virulence factors and may be involved in the
formation of a channel across the mycomembrane (Zhang et al. 2015). ESX-1 functions in resistance to and evasion of host responses.  It induces phagosomal rupture which releases bacteria into the cytosol of the host phagocytes (Gröschel et al. 2016). ESX-1 secrete EsxA and EsxB, which form a heterodimer, seem to have differing functions as EsxA can disrupt lipid bilayers (RBC and artificial membranes.

Mediates the secretion of the EsxN, PPE [pro-pro-glu motif] and PE_PGRS proteins (Deng and Xie 2012).  The EccB5, EccC5, EccD5 and EccE5 proteins form a membrane complex of about 1.5 MDa while EccA5 may be the channel-forming subunit that exports the substrate proteins (Bunduc et al. 2021). Thus, ESX-5 exports protein substrate (Houben et al. 2012).  PE25/PPE41form a heterodimer that is targeted to the T7SS, ESX5, by a C-terminal signal in PE25 which is necessary but not sufficient for targeting to ESX5 (Daleke et al. 2012).  An esx-5 mutant is strongly impaired in the uptake and utilization of 
hydrophobic carbon sources. Possibly the ESX-5 system is responsible for the transport of cell envelope
 proteins that are required for nutrient uptake (Ates et al. 2015).  Mycobacterium tuberculosis releases membrane vesicles (MV) that modulate host immune responses and aid in iron acquisition, and the ESX-5 system seems to play a role, together with the SenX3-RegX3 complex which regulates the process (White et al. 2018). The 3-D structure of ESX-5 has been determined (Bunduc et al. 2021) (see ESX5 family description, paragraph 11 for details). The structure of the mycobacterial ESX-5 type VII secretion system pore complex has been determined (Beckham et al. 2021). The high-resolution structure of the 2.1-megadalton ESX-5 core complex captured a dynamic, secretion-competent conformation of the pore within a well-defined transmembrane section, sandwiched between two flexible protein layers at the cytosolic entrance and the periplasmic exit. Beckham et al. 2021 proposed that this flexibility endows the ESX-5 machinery with large conformational plasticity required to accommodate targeted protein secretion. A highly dynamic state of the pore may represent a fundamental principle of bacterial secretion machineries.",{'secretion'},,,,{'8526': 'protein polypeptide chain'},{'8526': set()},R_3_A_24_4_1,{'8526': set()}

Mycobacterium smegmatis. Transcription of esx4 genes in the recipient 
requires coculture with a donor strain and a functional ESX-1 apparatus 
in the recipient. Conversely, mutation of the donor ESX-1 apparatus 
amplifies the esx4 transcriptional response in the recipient. The effect
 of ESX-1 on esx4 transcription correlates with conjugal DNA transfer 
efficiencies. Thus, intercellular communication via ESX-1 
controls the expression of its evolutionary progenitor, ESX-4, to 
promote conjugation between mycobacteria. The eight proteins listed under this TC# are all encoded withing a single gene cluster (Gray et al. 2016).",{'secretion'},,,,{'8526': 'protein polypeptide chain'},{'8526': set()},R_3_A_24_5_1,{'8526': set()}

This cytochrome bo3 ubiquinol oxidase is a transmembrane protein of 663 aas and 14 or 15 TMSs, which oxidizes ubiquinone and reduces oxygen, while pumping protons (Marušič et al. 2020). The cytochrome bo3 complex is the component of the aerobic respiratory chain of E. coli that
 predominates when cells are grown under high aeration conditions. It has proton pumping
activity, pumping 2
 protons/electron. Protons are probably pumped via D- and K-channels 
found in the cyoB subunit (Abramson et al. 2000). Two independent structures of the proton-pumping, respiratory cytochrome bo 3 ubiquinol oxidase (cytbo3) have been determined by cryo-EM in styrene-maleic acid (SMA) copolymer nanodiscs and in membrane scaffold protein (MSP) nanodiscs to 2.55- and 2.19-Å resolution, respectively (Li et al. 2021). The structures include the metal redox centers (heme b, heme o3 , and CuB), the redox-active cross-linked histidine-tyrosine cofactor, and the internal water molecules in the proton-conducting D channel. Each structure also contains one equivalent of ubiquinone-8 (UQ8) in the substrate binding site as well as several phospholipid molecules. The isoprene side chain of UQ8 is clamped within a hydrophobic groove in subunit I by TMS0, which is only present in quinol oxidases and not in the closely related cytochrome c oxidases. Both structures show carbonyl O1 of the UQ8 headgroup hydrogen bonded to D75(I) and R71(I). In both structures, residue H98(I) occupies two conformations. In conformation 1, H98(I) forms a hydrogen bond with carbonyl O4 of the UQ8 headgroup, but in conformation 2, the imidazole side chain of H98(I) has flipped to form a hydrogen bond with E14(I) at the N-terminal end of TMS0. The authors proposed that H98(I) dynamics facilitate proton transfer from ubiquinol to the periplasmic aqueous phase during oxidation of the substrate. Computational studies show that TMS0 creates a channel, allowing access of water to the ubiquinol headgroup and to H98(I) (Li et al. 2021). Jose et al. 2021 investigated the key PM intermediate, 
which forms after O–O bond cleavage and precedes proton pumping, using 
magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy. The authors observed features 
demonstrating that PM is a three-spin system, 
consistent with a consensus model including an iron(IV)-oxo species, 
a copper(II) ion, and a tyrosyl radical. These results provide validation of the O–O cleavage mechanism and open the door to 
understanding the proton pumping step (Jose et al. 2021).",{'uptake'},,,,{'5584': 'hydron'},{'5584': {'h'}},R_3_D_4_5_1,{'5584': set()}

There are three hydrophobic channels connecting the hydrophobic membrane through the protein to the heme A3/CuB binuclear center (BNC), two of which are probably preferred for O2 diffusion (Oliveira et al. 2014). The D channel is the proton transporting channel, and mutations in residues along this channel, especially N139 in subunit 1, uncouple H+ transport from electron flow (Han et al. 2005). Liang et al. 2017 provided insight into the decoupling mechanisms of CcO mutants, and explained how kinetic gating in the D-channel is imperative to achieving high proton-pumping efficiency in the WT CcO.

may have involved functional divergence from its RNF homologue (3.D.6) following duplication of the rnf operon, loss of the rnfB gene and the recruitment of the reductase subunit of an aromatic monooxygenase.  Two additional proteins, ApbE and NqrM (DUF539), are essential for 
activity. ApbE is responsible for covalent attachment of flavin 
mononucleotide (FMN) while NqrM (D0WX40) is necessary for biogenesis (Kostyrko et al. 2016).  NqrM has an N-terminal TMS and four cysteyl residues that are essential for full activity (Kostyrko et al. 2016). The 3D structure of NQR reveals a
transmembrane channel in subunit NqrB. Toulouse et al. 2016;  proposed that partial uncoupling of the Vibrio cholerae NQR observed

Diheme-containing succinate:menaquinone oxidoreductases (Sdh) are widespread in Gram-positive bacteria. Gong et al. 2020 presented the 2.8 Å cryo-EM structure of Sdh, which forms a trimer with a membrane-anchored SdhF as a subunit of the complex (PDB 6LUM).

The authors also identified two distal quinone-binding sites with bound quinones. One distal binding site is formed by neighboring subunits of the complex, and the electron/proton transfer pathway for succinate oxidation by menaquinone was revealed. The structure provides insight into the physiological significance of a trimeric respiratory complex II. The structure of the menaquinone binding site could provide a framework for the development of Sdh-selective anti-mycobacterial drugs (Gong et al. 2020). The architecture of SdhABC (type F), with a membrane-embedded Rieske FeS cluster, has been solved to 2.5 Å resolution (Zhou et al. 2021).

It is also called ComV1 or Ex3mV1Co. Channelrhodopsins have been utilized in gene therapy to restore vision in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (Hatakeyama et al. 2023). Channel kinetics (tauon and tauoff) were considerably altered by the replacement of the 172nd amino acid and was dependent on the amino acid characteristics. The size of amino acids at this position correlated with tauon and decay, whereas the solubility correlated with tauon and tauoff. Molecular dynamic simulation indicated that the ion tunnel constructed by H172, E121, and R306 widened due to H172A variant, whereas the interaction between A172 and the surrounding amino acids weakened compared with H172. The bottleneck radius of the ion gate constructed with the 172nd amino acid affected the photocurrent and channel kinetics. The 172nd amino acid in ComV1 is a key residue for determining channel kinetics as its properties alter the radius of the ion gate (Hatakeyama et al. 2023).",{'uptake'},,,,{'5584': 'hydron'},{'5584': {'h'}},R_3_E_1_7_8,{'5584': set()}

 support to allow capture and conversion of solar energy as an 
alternative fuel source (Harrold et al. 2013). This RC may catalyze transmembrane electron transfer, as for members of TC class 5 (Khatypov et al. 2017). Cytochrome bc1 and the reaction centre complex are in proximity in live Rhodobacter sphaeroides cells (Vasilev et al. 2021).  Dipyridamole (DIP) alters the efficiency of energy transfer from the light-harvesting complex LH2 to the LH1-reaction center core complex and to produce the long-wavelength (""red"") shift of the absorption band of light-harvesting bacteriochlorophyll molecules in the IR spectral region at 840-900 nm (Knox et al. 2022). This shift is associated with the membrane transition to the energized state. DIP reduces the photooxidized bacteriochlorophyll of the reaction center, which accelerated electron flow along the electron transport chain, thereby stimulating generation of the transmembrane potential on the chromatophore membrane (Knox et al. 2022).  Tools for analyzing protonation states and for tracing proton transfer pathways have been developed with examples from the Rb. sphaeroides photosynthetic reaction centers (Wei et al. 2023).",{'uptake'},,,,{},{},R_3_E_2_1_1,{}

Newly identified exterior Cars functioned with the bacteriochlorophyll B800 to block the proposed quinone channel between LHα and LHβ subunits in the nRC-LH, forming a sealed LH ring that was disrupted by transmembrane helices from cytochrome c and subunit X to allow quinone shuttling. dRC-LH lacked subunit X, leading to an exposed LH ring with a larger opening, which together accelerated the quinone exchange rate. The authors also assigned amino acid sequences to subunit X and two hypothetical proteins (Y and Z) that functioned in forming the quinone channel and stabilizing the RC-LH interactions.

6145,3.E.2.2.1,Bacteria,Cyanobacteriota,Cyanobacterial photosystem II in thylakoid membranes (Sarcina et al,"Cyanobacterial photosystem II in thylakoid membranes (Sarcina et al. 2006). Photosynthetic water oxidation is catalyzed by the Mn4CaO5 cluster of photosystem II (PSII) with linear progression through five S-state intermediates (S0 to S4). To reveal the mechanism of water oxidation, Suga et al. 2019 analyzed structures of PSII of Thermosynechococcus vulcanus in the S1, S2, and S3 states by x-ray free-electron laser serial crystallography. No insertion of water was found in S2, but flipping of D1 Glu189 upon transition to S3 led to the opening of a water channel and provided a space for 
incorporation of an additional oxygen ligand, resulting in an open 
cubane Mn4CaO6 cluster with an oxyl/oxo bridge. 
Structural changes of PSII between the different S states revealed 
cooperative action of substrate water access, proton release, and 
dioxygen formation in photosynthetic water oxidation (Suga et al. 2019). The oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) is located at a node of five water channels involved in proton release, balancing the net charge of the OEC, and inlet of substrate water (Shen 2015). The PsbJ protein is required for photosystem II activity in centers lacking the PsbO and PsbV lumenal subunits (Choo et al. 2021).
The mechanisms by which protons move into the buried active sites of Photosystem II (PSII), bacterial RCs (bRCs) and through the proton pumps, Bacteriorhodopsin (bR), Complex I and Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), have been reviewed by Kaur et al. 2021. These proteins all use water filled proton transfer paths. The proton pumps, that move protons uphill from low to high concentration compartments, also utilize Proton Loading Sites (PLS), that transiently load and unload protons, and gates, which block backflow of the protons. PLS and gates must be synchronized so PLS proton affinity is high when the gate opens to the side with few protons and low when the path is open to the high concentration side. Proton transfer paths have different design features (Kaur et al. 2021).",{'uptake'},,,,{'5584': 'hydron'},{'5584': {'h'}},R_3_E_2_2_1,{'5584': set()}

The IIC domain has been crystallized, and x-ray data to 4.5 Å resolution have been described (Zurbriggen et al. 2010).  The system has been manipulated to engineer increased production of aromatic metabolites (Carmona et al. 2015, Vargas-Tah et al. 2015). The presence or absence of D-glucose reflects the transporter before and after release of the transported glucose into the cytoplasm. The transition associated with substrate release appears to require a subtle structural rearrangement in the region that includes hairpin 1 (Kalbermatter et al. 2017).  Mlc (for makes large colonies) represses transcription of the genes 
encoding enzyme I, HPr, EIIBCGlc and EIIABCDMan in defined media that lack PTS
 substrates. When glucose is present, the unphosphorylated form of 
EIIBCGlc sequesters Mlc to the cell membrane, preventing its 
interaction with DNA (Plumbridge 2002, Joyet et al. 2013). The Vibrio Mlc functions similarly (Pickering et al. 2014). A small (43 aa) protein, SgrT, acts in tandem with a well-characterized small RNA during metabolic 
stress, due to the accumulation of cytoplasmic sugar-Ps to help bacterial cells maintain balanced metabolism and continue
 growing. SgrT acts on the glucose 
transport system, inhibiting its activity under stress conditions in 
order to allow cells to utilize alternative carbon sources (Lloyd et al. 2017). ptsG mRNA localization to the inner membrane, coupled with the membrane insertion of nascent peptide, mediates Hfq/SgrS-dependent ptsG mRNA destabilization, presumably by reducing second rounds of translation (Kawamoto et al. 2005). SgrT is a small protein of 43 aas that allosterically inhibits IICBGlc. while SgrS is a small RNA coompementary to ptsG mRNA that influences its expression.  The sgrST operon is regulated by SgrR, a glucose-6-P-dependent transcriptional activator (Jeckelmann and Erni 2020).",{'uptake'},pts,-,-->,{'4167': 'D-glucopyranose'},{'4167': {'glc__D'}},R_4_A_1_1_1,{'4167': {'glc__D_e + pep_c --> g6p_c + pyr_c'}}

 uses d-glucosaminate (2-amino-2-deoxy-d-gluconic acid) as a carbon and 
nitrogen source via DgaABCD (d-glucosaminate PTS permease components EIIA, EIIB, EIIC, and EIID). Two other genes in the
 dga operon (dgaE and dgaF) are required for wild-type growth with d-glucosaminate. Transcription of dgaABCDEF is 
dependent on RpoN (σ54) and an RpoN-dependent activator gene, dgaR. Introduction of a plasmid bearing dgaABCDEF under the 
control of the lac promoter into E. coli strains allowed them to grow on minimal 
medium containing d-glucosaminate. d-Glucosaminate is transported and
 phosphorylated at the C-6 position by DgaABCD. DgaE converts the 
resulting d-glucosaminate-6-phosphate to 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate 
6-phosphate (KDGP), which is subsequently cleaved by the aldolase DgaF 
to form glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate. DgaF catalyzes the same
 reaction as that catalyzed by Eda, a KDGP aldolase in the 
Entner-Doudoroff pathway, and the two enzymes can substitute for each 
other in their respective pathways. Orthologs of the dga genes are

Substrate- and product-bound structures of BcsA provided the basis for 
substrate recognition and demonstrated the stepwise elongation of 
cellulose. Structural snapshots showed that BcsA 
translocates cellulose via a ratcheting mechanism involving a 'finger 
helix' that contacts the polymer's terminal glucose. Cooperating with 
BcsA's gating loop, the finger helix moves 'up' and 'down' in response 
to substrate binding and polymer elongation, respectively, thereby 
pushing the elongated polymer into BcsA's transmembrane channel. This 
mechanism was validated by tethering BcsA's finger helix, 
which inhibits polymer translocation but not elongation (Morgan et al. 2016).",{'uptake'},,,,{'3529': '(1->4)-beta-D-glucan'},{'3529': set()},R_4_D_3_1_5,{'3529': set()}

cysteines on secreted proteins from irreversible oxidation, reduce 
methionine sulfoxides, and scavenge reactive oxygen species such as 
hydrogen peroxide (Cho and Collet 2013). DsbD x-ray structures are known, revealing its unusual redox properties and extreme rigidity (Stirnimann et al. 2006).  DsbD contains two periplasmically oriented domains at the N- and C-termini (nDsbD and cDsbD) that are connected by a central transmembrane (TM) domain. Each domain contains a pair of cysteines that are essential for catalysis. Cys109 and Cys461 form a transient interdomain disulfide bond between nDsbD and cDsbD in the reaction cycle. The crystal structure of this catalytic intermediate at 2.85 Å resolution revealed large relative domain movements in DsbD as a consequence of a strong overlap between the surface areas of nDsbD that interact with DsbC and cDsbD (Rozhkova et al. 2004).",{'uptake'},,,,{'10545': 'electron'},{'10545': set()},R_5_A_1_1_1,{'10545': set()}

Photosystem I (PSI) is a large protein supercomplex that catalyzes the light-dependent oxidation of plastocyanin (or cytochrome c6 ) and the reduction of ferredoxin. This catalytic reaction is realized by a transmembrane electron transfer chain consisting of a primary electron donor (a special chlorophyll (Chl) pair) and electron acceptors A0 , A1 , and three Fe4 S4 clusters, FX , FA , and FB. Xu et al. 2021 reported the PSI structure from a Chl d-dominated cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina at 3.3 Å resolution obtained by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The A. marina PSI exists as a trimer with three identical monomers. The structure reveals a unique composition of electron transfer chain proteins in which the primary electron acceptor, A0, is composed of two pheophytins a rather than Chl a found in other well-known PSI structures. A novel subunit Psa27 is observed in the A. marina PSI structure. In addition, 77 Chls, 13 alpha-carotenes, two phylloquinones, three Fe-S clusters, two phosphatidyl glycerols, and one monogalactosyl-diglyceride were identified in each PSI monomer. This provides a structural basis for deciphering the mechanism of photosynthesis in a PSI complex with Chl d as the dominating pigment, absorbing far-red light (Xu et al. 2021).",{'uptake'},,,,{},{},R_5_B_4_1_2,{}

MtrABC is composed of two decahaem cytochromes (MtrA & B) brought together inside a transmembrane β-porin (MtrC) to transport electrons across the outer membrane to mineral based electron acceptors (White et al. 2012).  Conduction through MtrCAB
directly to Fe(III) oxides occurs both in vitro in liposomes and in vivo, allowing anaerobic, solid-phase iron
respiration (White et al. 2013). MtrC interacts with the surface of MtrAB, extending ∼70 Å from the membrane surface and allowing the terminal hemes to interact with both MtrAB and
 an extracellular acceptor. MtrA fully extends
 through the length of MtrB, with ∼30 Å being exposed into the 
periplasm. MtrCAB can reduce Fe(III) citrate with STC as an electron donor, 
disclosing a direct interaction between MtrCAB and STC (Edwards et al. 2018). MtrC, but not UndA (a paralog of MtrC of 843 aas; F8UWD6), appears to be the primary reductase of flavins to ensure fast indirect extracellular electron transfer (EET), which plays a crucial role in microbial fuel cell (MFC) electricity generation in Shewanella putrefaciens CN32 (Wu et al. 2018). The dimensions of MtrAB are approximately 105 x 60 x 35 Å and approximately 170 x 60 x 45 Å for MtrCAB. Their shapes suggest that MtrC interacts with the surface of MtrAB, extending approximately 70 Å from the membrane surface and allowing the terminal hemes to interact with both MtrAB and an extracellular acceptor. MtrA fully extends through the length of MtrB, with approximately 30 Å being exposed into the periplasm (Edwards et al. 2018). The multihaem proteins can act as transmembrane molecular electron conduits (Stikane et al. 2019). Thus, MtrCAB iss a lipid membrane-spanning building block for compartmentalized photocatalysis that mimics photosynthesis. The atomic structure of an outer membrane spanning protein complex, MtrAB, that is representative of a protein family known to transport electrons between the interior and exterior environments of phylogenetically and metabolically diverse microorganisms, has been solved. The structure is revealed as a naturally insulated biomolecular wire possessing a 10-heme cytochrome, MtrA, insulated from the membrane lipidic environment by embedding within a 26 strand beta-barrel formed by MtrB. MtrAB forms a connection with an extracellular 10-heme cytochrome, MtrC, which presents its hemes across a large surface area for electrical contact with extracellular redox partners, including transition metals and electrodes (Edwards et al. 2020).",{'uptake'},,,,{'10545': 'electron'},{'10545': set()},R_5_B_5_1_1,{'10545': set()}

Photoferrotrophy is a form of anoxygenic photosynthesis whereby bacteria
 utilize soluble or insoluble forms of ferrous iron as an electron donor
 to fix carbon dioxide using light energy. They can also use poised 
electrodes as their electron donor via phototrophic extracellular 
electron uptake (phototrophic EEU). Gupta et al. 2019 showed that the single periplasmic decaheme cytochrome c, PioA, and the outer membrane porin, PioB, form a complex allowing extracellular electron uptake across the outer membrane from both soluble iron and poised electrodes. They observed that PioA 
undergoes postsecretory proteolysis of its N terminus to produce a 
shorter heme-attached PioA (holo-PioAC, where PioAC represents the C terminus of PioA), which can exist both freely in the 
periplasm and in a complex with PioB. The extended N-terminal peptide 
controls heme attachment, and its processing is required to produce 
wild-type levels of the holo-PioAC and holo-PioACB

Podocytes are crucial cells of the glomerular filtration unit that play a vital role at the interface of the blood-urine barrier. Podocyte slit-diaphragm is a modified tight junction that facilitates size and charge-dependent permselectivity. Several proteins including podocin, nephrin (TC# 8.a.23.1.33), CD2AP (8.A.34.1.5), and TRPC6 (1.A.4.1.5) form a macromolecular assembly that constitutes the slit-diaphragm that resembles tight junctions. Podocin is an integral membrane protein attached to the inner membrane of the podocyte via a short transmembrane region (101-125). The cytosolic N- and C-termini help podocin attain a hook-like structure. The protein forms a homooligomer, a 16-mer (Mulukala et al. 2020).",{'uptake'},,,,{},{},R_8_A_21_1_2,{}

 necessary for synaptic hippocampal plasticity and memory recall (Schmitz et al. 2017). Shisa7 controls receptor abundance at synapses and speeds up the channel deactivation kinetics. Shisa7 also potently enhances the action of diazepam, a classic benzodiazepine, on GABAARs. Genetic deletion of Shisa7 selectively impairs GABAergic transmission and diminishes the effects of diazepam in mice. Thus, Shisa7 regulates GABAAR trafficking, function, and pharmacology (Han et al. 2019).

It functions with a high affinity, slow turnover heavy metal transporting ATPase CtpC (Rv3270; TC#3.A.3.32.2), which is required for virulence. It controls the Mn2+ cytoplasmic quota and is involved in the uploading of Mn2+ into secreted metalloproteins (Padilla-Benavides et al. 2013). It shows a preference for Mn2+, but Zn2+, Co2+ and Cu2+ can act as alternative substrates although at slower turnover rates (Padilla-Benavides et al. 2013). Boudehen et al. 2022 showed that zinc resistance also depends on a chaperone-like protein, 
PacL1 (Rv3269). PacL1 contains an N-terminal TMS, a cytoplasmic 
region with glutamine/alanine repeats and a C-terminal metal-binding 
motif (MBM). PacL1 binds Zn2+, but the MBM is required only 
at high zinc concentrations. PacL1 co-localizes with CtpC, a heavy metal cation-transporting P-type ATPase, in dynamic 
foci in the mycobacterial plasma membrane, and the two proteins form 
high molecular weight complexes. Foci formation does not require 
flotillin or the PacL1 MBM. However, deletion of the PacL1 Glu/Ala 
repeats leads to loss of CtpC and sensitivity to zinc. Genes pacL1 and ctpC appear to be in the same operon, and homologous gene pairs are found in
 the genomes of other bacteria. PacL1 colocalizes and functions 
redundantly with other PacL orthologs in M. tuberculosis. Thus, 
PacL proteins may act as scaffolds that assemble P-ATPase-containing 
metal efflux platforms, mediating bacterial resistance to metal poisoning

This protein plays an important role in maintaining outer membrane integrity (Bryant et al. 2020, Ranava et al. 2021). It supports proper folding and function of BamA under envelope stress conditions (Ranava et al. 2021) and binds specifically to anionic phospholipids via the BON 2 domain (Bryant et al. 2020).
 This interaction is essential for function and guides the protein to 
the cell division site. It mediates co-selection of antibiotic and heavy
 metal resistance in bacteria (Sun et al. 2023). It functions like an efflux pump to confer resistance to various antibiotics, especially for ceftazidime, with a >32-fold increase in minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). The BON protein could interact with several metal ions, such as copper and silver, which have been associated with the induced co-regulation of antibiotic and heavy metal resistance in bacteria. The BON protein was shown to spontaneously self-assemble into a trimer and generate a central pore-like architecture for antibiotic transport. A WXG motif as a molecular switch is essential for forming the transmembrane oligomeric pores and controls the interaction between the BON protein and the cell membrane. A mechanism termed ""one-in, one-out"", was proposed. This study provides new insights into the structure and function of BON proteins and a previously unidentified resistance mechanism (Sun et al. 2023).",{'uptake'},,,,"{'30051': 'silver(1+)', '49480': 'gold(1+)', '3508': 'ceftazidime', '23888': 'drug'}","{'30051': {'ag'}, '49480': set(), '3508': set(), '23888': set()}",R_8_A_213_1_1,"{'30051': set(), '49480': set(), '3508': set(), '23888': set()}"

Bacterial autotrophs often rely on CO2 concentrating 
mechanisms (CCMs) to assimilate carbon. Desmarais et al. 2019 performed a genome-wide barcoded transposon screen to 
identify essential and CCM-related genes in the γ-proteobacterium 
Halothiobacillus neapolitanus. Screening revealed that the CCM comprises
 at least 17 and probably no more than 25 genes, most of which are 
encoded in 3 operons. Two of these operons (DAB1 and DAB2) contain a 
two-gene locus that encodes a domain of unknown function (Pfam: PF10070)
 and a putative cation transporter (Pfam: PF00361). Physiological and 
biochemical assays demonstrated that these proteins (named DabA 
and DabB for ""DABs accumulate bicarbonate"") - assemble into a heterodimeric 
complex that contains a putative β-carbonic anhydrase-like active site
 and functions as an energy-coupled inorganic carbon (Ci) 
pump. DAB operons are found in a diverse range of 
bacteria and archaea. Desmarais et al. 2019 demonstrated that functional DABs are present in
 the human pathogens, Bacillus anthracis and Vibrio cholerae. They proposed that DABs constitute a class of 
energized Ci pumps and play a critical role in the metabolism of Ci throughout prokaryotic phyla. Since the uptake of Ci is inhibited by the ionophore CCCP, DAB2 activity may be energetically coupled to a cation gradient, and as DabA2–DabB2 shows pH-independent rescue of carbonic anhydrase-free E. coli, CO2 is probably the transported substrate. Holthuijzen et al 1987 (DOI 10.1007/BF00463489) reported similar findings for Halothiobacillus neapolitanus, and (Menning et al. 2016) got similar results for Hydrogenovibrio crunogenus (Thiomicrospira crunogena). Both DAB operons in Halothiobacillus are required; each having an HCR phenotype when knocked out.

The bacterial BacA protein is essential for bacteroid 
differentiation in legumes producing nodule-specific cysteine-rich 
peptides (NCRs), which induce the terminal differentiation of the 
bacteria into bacteroids (Haag et al. 2013). This protein and others in this family are homologous to the membrane constituents of 3.A.1.203 family in the ABC superfamily in TCDB. Takes up phazolicin (PHZ), a peptide antibiotic (Travin et al. 2023). The frequency of spontaneous PHZ-resistant mutants in Sinorhizobium 
meliloti is below the detection limit because PHZ can enter S. 
meliloti cells through two promiscuous peptide transporters,, 
BacA (TC# 9.A.18.1.2) and YejABEF (TC# 3.A.1.5.49), which belong to the SLiPT (SbmA-like peptide 
transporter) and ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter families, 
respectively. The dual-uptake mode explains the lack of observed 
resistance acquisition because the simultaneous inactivation of both 
transporters is necessary for resistance to PHZ. Since both BacA and 
YejABEF are essential for the development of functional symbiosis of S. 
meliloti with leguminous plants, the unlikely acquisition of PHZ 
resistance via the inactivation of these transporters is further 
disfavored. A whole-genome transposon sequencing screen did not reveal 
additional genes that can provide strong PHZ resistance when 
inactivated. However, it was found that the capsular polysaccharide KPS, a novel putative envelope polysaccharide PPP (PHZ-protecting 
polysaccharide), as well as the peptidoglycan layer jointly contribute 
to the sensitivity of S. meliloti to PHZ, most likely serving as 
barriers that reduce the amount of PHZ transported inside the cell (Travin et al. 2023).",{'uptake'},,,,"{'7990': 'peptide', '3139': 'bleomycin A2'}","{'7990': set(), '3139': set()}",R_9_A_18_1_2,"{'7990': set(), '3139': set()}"

groove. The cavity is large enough to hold hundreds of water molecules, and is accessible to the external milieu by means of gaps
 between splayed transmembrane helices (Sanders and Hutchison 2018). Possibly cleavage 
proceeds by means of a processive mechanism of substrate insertion, 
translocation, and ejection (Pryor et al. 2013). The active site is just under the interfacial lid of the barrel, with substrate entry and product exit through fenestrations located near the upper end of the barrel, just under the water-bilayer interface (Sanders and Hutchison 2018).",{'uptake'},,,,"{'25906': 'peptide', '14911': 'protein'}","{'25906': set(), '14911': set()}",R_9_B_1_1_4,"{'25906': set(), '14911': set()}"

(cytochrome c synthetase) activities.  Two heme binding sites have been 
identified in a homologue, one in the membrane and one on the external 
surface (on the periplasmic side of the membrane) (Sutherland et al. 2018). Mendez et al. 2022 described cryo-EM structures of CcsBA, which, as noted above, is a bifunctional heme transporter and cytochrome c (cyt c) synthase. Models built from the cryo-EM densities show that CcsBA is trapped with heme in two conformations, closed and open states. The closed state has heme located solely at a transmembrane (TM) site, with a large periplasmic domain oriented such that access of heme to the cytochrome acceptor is prevented. The open conformation contains two heme moieties, one in the TM-heme site and another in an external site (P-heme site). The presence of heme in the periplasmic site at the base of a chamber induces a large conformational shift that exposes the heme for reaction with apocytochrome c (apocyt c). Consistent with these structures, in vivo and in vitro cyt c synthase studies suggest a mechanism for transfer of the periplasmic heme to cytochrome (Mendez et al. 2022).",{'uptake'},,,,{},{},R_9_B_14_3_1,{}

acid resistance mechanism exhibited only at high cell densities (Mates et al. 2007). H-NS directly controls expression of the hedD gene (Krin et al. 2010).  Both small RNAs, CyaR and RprA, interact with the 5'-UTR of hdeD mRNA, and binding to the RBS of hdeD, interfers with translational initiation. Lalaouna et al. 2018 identified an A/U-rich motif on hdeD,
 which is bound by the RNA chaperone Hfq. The results indicate that 
binding of this motif by Hfq is required for CyaR-induced degradation of
 hdeD mRNA, and two molecules of RprA must bind the 5'-UTR of hdeD to block translation initiation. While both CyaR and RprA sRNAs bind to the same motif on the hdeD mRNA, RprA solely acts at the translational level, leaving the target RNA intact (Lalaouna et al. 2018).

Its structural gene, pmpA, is adjacent to pmpB (TC# 9.B.102.5.5) which encodes another small 4 TMS protein of opposite orientation in the membrane.  These genes and pmpC, encoding a transporter of the TSUP family (2.A.102) that might function in sulfur or selenium metabolism (Lin et al. 2015), are localized in a gene cluster concerned with prodigiosin (red pigment (Darshan and Manonmani 2015)) production (Gristwood et al. 2011).  Hence, PmpA/PmpB might export prodigiosin, but no direct evidence is available to support such a possibility.  Prodigiosin is an aromatic compound that does not contain sulfur.Interestingly, The ability of pigmented strains of Serratia marcescens to grow on bread has led to a possible explanation for transubstantiation miracles, in which eucharistic bread is converted into the body of Christ. Such miracles led to Pope Urban IV to institut the feast of Corpus Christi in 1264. This followed celebration of a mass of Bolsena in 1263, led by a Bohemian priest who had doubts concerning transsubstantiation. 
 During the Mass, the eucharist appeared to bleed, and each time the 
priest wiped away the blood, more would appear. This event is celebrated

Access to water molecules is provided by a central cavity that opens to the extracellular region and converges on Ser201. One of the two GlpG molecules in the asymmetric unit has an open conformation at the active site, with TMS 5 bent away from the rest of the molecule. Substrate entry to the active site is probably gated by the movement of TMS 5 (Wu et al. 2006).

The active site is inside the membrane, but near the surface, to release the hydrophilic ectodomain of its single TMS substrate. These enzymes may thin the membrane, allowing access of water to the active site. There is a cavity adjacent to the cleavage site containing ordered water molecules, involved in access to the substrate before cleavage (Sanders and Hutchison 2018).

which produces the secreted peptide toxin SDP. Unlike sdpABC, yitPOM is 
induced in biofilms by the DegS-DegU two-component regulatory system. 
High yitPOM expression leads to the production of a secreted toxin 
called YIT. Expression of yitQ, which lies upstream of yitPOM, confers 
resistance to the YIT toxin, suggesting that YitQ is an anti-toxin 
protein for the YIT toxin. The alternative sigma factor SigW also 
contributes to YIT toxin resistance. In a mutant lacking yitQ and sigW, 
the YIT toxin specifically inhibits biofilm formation, and the 
extracellular neutral protease NprB is required for this inhibition (Kobayashi and Ikemoto 2019).",{'uptake'},,,,{},{},R_9_B_139_1_6,{}

The major outer sheath protein (Msp or MOSP) has a bipartite domain architecture and exists as periplasmic and outer membrane-spanning conformers (Anand et al. 2013). The Msp complex
 depolarized and increased the conductance of the HeLa cell membrane in a
 manner which was not strongly selective for Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl-  ions. Cell-attached patches of HeLa cell membrane exposed to the Msp complex exhibited short-lived channels with a slope conductance of 0.4 nS in physiologically normal saline (Mathers et al. 1996). Pore-forming activities of recombinant Msp in black lipid model membrane assays and in HeLa cell membranes were 
similar to those reported for the native protein, supporting the 
hypothesis that Msp cytotoxicity is due to its pore-forming activity (Fenno et al. 1998). The oligomeric outer membrane-associated complex binds fibronectin and disrupts several intracellular responses.It may form a large-diameter β-barrel porin (Godovikova et al. 2019).
